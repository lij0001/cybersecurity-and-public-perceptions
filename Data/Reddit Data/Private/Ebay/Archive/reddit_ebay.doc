FTFY\n\nYSK that eBay suffered a massive data breach earlier this *YEAR*, *discovered it this week*, and is encouraging all of their users to change their passwords immediately.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Hi,\njust wondering why you are such a jerk in your product description.. Are you really so blindly unaware of the necessity of respecting customers in a business forum?\nDo you really believe that your comic sans rant under the facade of a waive of consumer right is not only in breach of ebay guidelines but also Australian consumer law?\n\nSent as a question to seller under the subject "Customer Enquiry"\n\nLet's flood that inbox reddit.

Use a secure password manager to manage them. \n- Setup 2-step verification if it's available in your country.

The hackers then hack into eBay's database to make sure that the problem is exposed so eBay will fix it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             So I send this person a message letting her know what I think of her practice and she replied: "you are in breach of the ebay user agreement lol; and a disgusting excuse for a human being; everything you give comes back :)"
That dump [was reported to be fake](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/22/us-ebay-password-idUSBREA4K0B420140522) according to Ebay. The contents of the CSV look to be from an earlier, unrelated leak.\n\n&gt;Someone posted a batch of emails, scrambled passwords, phone numbers and addresses of more than 12,000 people on the Internet, saying it was a sample of data stolen from eBay and offering to sell the full batch for 1.453 bitcoin, or a little more than $750.\n\n&gt;EBay's Miller said the information was not authentic.\n\n&gt;Reuters spoke to six people whose phone numbers were included in that batch. While only four said they had eBay accounts, all of them said the data was correct, which suggests they may have been victims of another data breach.
                                                                                                                                          There is a difference between reminding your users to update their passwords, security questions and answers, and privacy settings, and flat-out announcing there was a breach.  A business is always going to err on the side of caution and get 100% confirmation before announcing that there was a fuck up.  \n\nWhat good would it do if eBay, or any company, announced that there was a breach in February, and then in May said "*Oops, nah, it was nothing.*"  Which is worse, acknowledging an issue with the benefit of having time to research and spin things, or regularly announcing your ineptitude at identifying possible hacks?
