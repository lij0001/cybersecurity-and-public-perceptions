The U.S. can shut down anyones power grid and anyone can shut down our power grid. This is because its a continuous maintenance structure. If the system becomes closed and tightened it would be rather difficult to let some guy in the middle of nowhere fix a transformer. If you think its a bitch to get your power back on after a storm now just think what it would be like if there was a single government entity in charge of its integrity. \n\nThere is also the concept of keeping the grid spaced out to increase its depth. If one government entity was in charge what if that one entity was hacked? Having an open system makes more difficult for smaller hackers to be able to infiltrate a vast disconnected system. Only a large nation-state with a robust hacking corp ,like China, would be able to hack our systems. That's actually a good thing because if China were ever shut down our power grid it would be an act of war. So China would never do this because they know if they shut down our national power grid thousands of people would die. People on home oxygen-elderly people living in 110 degree weather-kids in winter with no heat-water is pumped by electricity- etc etc. Being able to hold a nation-state responsible is actually much safer because if we put the integrity of the system under one entity then it would be more vulnerable to a single hacker. Much in the same way that we have no problem China having nukes but if a single terrorist gets a hold of one then we are fucked.  \n\nThere's also this to consider. Do we really want all of our power usage to be in a system that is regulated and overwatched by the government? Do you really want the government to know what you're doing at all times? Because if the government is in charge of your power they can do this. When you get home-when you watch tv-when get online-what you use your lights/power for. Ever heard of a smartmeter? Some people consider this an invasion of privacy because your power by device is tracked at your home instead of just raw usage. Example: You grow weed. The government can get a warrant from a judge because you use so much power they suspect you have a grow room. It happens all the time. Now imagine you have a smartmeter. You don't have to use a large amount of power to get caught because they can tell you use 600 watts every 12 hours. Just think if the government was in charge of watching all of your power usage. If you say "Well If you're not breaking the law then you have nothing to worry about"  Why not get rid of all privacy laws then? You don't have to be a stoner to worry-Do you really want the government knowing when you get home? When you take a shower? When you eat? When you get online? If you don't have a healthy fear of the government do you have complete faith that someone can't get those records outside of the government?\n\nThe government already has full access to your bank accounts-emails-texts-phone usage-health care etc etc. We've all allowed this due to government regulations. Now the government wants to regulate the internet and with a little fear mongering it looks as if it wants to watch your power usage. If you grow weed ,text your buddy, go to the ATM,piss hot on a drug test, guess what- The government can track you from A-Z. If you do this in your 20's by the time your old enough to run for president at 35 you're going to have everything in your life documented.\n\n Is this the kind of privacy that we as Americans want? \n\n"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." - Benjamin Franklin\n\n  \n\n

                      &gt;Officials also said that the agency did not notify the proper authorities when it learned of the attack.\n\nThat line should be the most disconcerting.  It's one thing to have China hack the weather systems (mind you, the weather service uses the same technology that the Defense Department has used to detect missile launches, track enemy aircraft, and to monitor the skies over the United States), that is expected - they've been doing it for several years now.\n\nIt's a completely different can of worms to have the bureaucrats fail to follow the procedures in place to recognize and find solutions to these attacks on American sovereignty.  It is simply amazing that this situation was not handled properly, and I am, probably more so than I should be, in awe.

Being 17 and on the streets (albeit the cushy 'hood that Austin is) was a more than justifiable reason in my head. I stood outside in near-freezing weather every single day to grab a fucking lottery ticket so I could sleep inside the shelter. Not the Salvation Army Center, for people like yourself who have degrees and are capable of getting jobs, but the fucking ARCH. \n\nIf my ticket number wasn't 0-100, I wasn't getting in. I learned to scrounge up $2 on a daily basis so I could trade it to whatever crackhead was in a 'crack critical' state in exchange for a good ticket. \n\nSure the whistles and catcalls from men twice my age bothered me. Sure, the nasty-ass food that they only (at the time) served 1-2 times a day in various locations throughout Austin bothered me. Sure, staying on Rundberg outside the fucking Austin Motel on the ground amidst the piss when I couldn't get a ticket bothered me.\n\nBut none of the above were what changed me. You seem to be at that state. The state in which you pity yourself and wish for others around you to empathize. \n\n&gt;**"But I'm posting here asking for help! What do you mean?!"**\n\nI mean exactly what my original statement was, you're not as committed as you say. \n\nWhat changed me was one day, I was spouting the same type of sob story to my homeless entourage while passing a joint of some meccie shit-weed around under the 5th street/IH-35 overpass (unfortunately I didn't have the luxury of internet as you do). \n\n**"The man's out to get a motherfucker yo. Motherfuckers can't get up no matter they race. Life's a motherfucking bitch."** *(Yes I really talked like this. I am ashamed, but I guess if you hang around shit you smell like shit.)*\n\nThat right there was the exact last 3 sentences I mentioned to this group of nodding vagrants. Leaving the praise and agreement behind, I moved to a different group of my panhandling brethren north just a block under the 6th street/IH-35 overpass. Joint still in hand at this point, I listened as an older homeless crackhead rattled on his sob story (a pretty common thing as I'm sure you're realizing):\n\n**"The man's out to get a motherfucker yo. Motherfuckers can't get up no matter they race. Life's a motherfucking bitch."**\n\nLike he was fucking reading a script, this guy literally repeated the last 3 sentences I said, right back to me. I was flabbergasted. Not a single person in this new group had heard me say it or were within earshot at the time of me saying it. Having felt such strong agreement with that statement before, I let him know I agreed with him and proceeded to spit out the most important question I've ever asked anyone:\n\n**ME**: "Fuck man how long you been trickin these streets?"\n\n**HIM**: "Shit 20-something fuckin years now! Shit's rough, life's a bitch my dude."\n\nThis exchange hit me like a ton of bricks. I realized that there were people out there with my 17-year old mentality who had never changed and thus had stayed on the streets their whole fucking life. It rocked me down to my fundamentals and stole away any comfort I thought I had in 'knowing' anything about my reality. \n\nTwo days later, I had a job washing dishes 70 hours a week at an Italian restaurant in fucking GEORGETOWN. For those of you unaware, Georgetown is a small city north of Austin, with good food and weird old people. However, without a car, bus or anything of the like, how was I supposed to get there? For the first few shifts I hitched up there and back down to the shelter. That lasted all of like 3 days. Fortunately people in Austin are friendly enough, but a dishwasher gets out later than anyone. Try finding a ride back south in the cold 1AM timeframe from Georgetown. Ain't happening. \n\nSo I talked with my chef, let him know what the deal was and he gave me a cash advance so I could buy the cheapest tent Academy had. I set up in the woods about a mile away from my job and burned fucking barrel fires down to coals (no ventilation for open fires in cheap Academy tent) and brought a bucket of coals into the tent so I wouldn't freeze my dick off.\n\nAfter 2 paychecks, spring was starting to come around and it was starting to warm up a bit. I also had enough money that I could rent out a couch no bigger than 2 carseats put together. I paid $200/mo plus 4-way split in bills to sleep in that bullshit couch. All the while sneezing my ass off cause the owners had cats and I'm allergic as hell. \n\nI'm going to go ahead and forego the rest as it doesn't emphasize my point as much. However, when I see stories like yours it makes me shake my head and go "There's no fucking way what you're telling me is 100% true." Because I've been there. I know what it's like. And you've got 100 times the privilege I had. \n\nMy advice? Enjoy your time on the streets. I mean it in the most sincere fashion. While you may be stressed a bit now, you'll look back on this as the most stress-free you've ever been. And until you're ready to change the situation with every ounce of effort your body can produce, stick to telling your story to your homeless friends and not the internet. \n\n**EDIT**: I'd also like to add that the point of this was to give advice and help someone calibrate where they are in their life correspondent to a particular set of circumstances of which I am familiar with. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. No matter the good advice I've seen on here, my **TL;DR is that I'm trying to call this poor bastard out and make him realize that the help he needs isn't from other people, but rather it's something that needs to stem from internal stimuli.**

They've done this many times in the past (hacked the AP Twitter feed in 2013 so their own altered content appears on any news service that pulled articles from the AP twitter feed). \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5LzF8fX.jpg\n\nSocial media sites are as hard to "hack" as the stupidity of the user who failed to choose a complex password or the gullibility of somebody working at a news/media company who willingly gives out their log in information for 3rd party source sites. They (SEA) spend countless hours phishing for passwords from all the news feed companies (create elaborate websites that look like the real thing, then send new alerts to AP, Reuters, etc, with links that take the user to their fake website and then the user tries to enter the proper AP or Reuters user/password info -- at that point SEA now has their real credentials to log into the real AP or Reuters website and post fake news).\n\n\n**edit:** this has turned into a pain in the ass for me. It also effected a few weather apps (PC and mobile), so this morning I'm being bombarded by clients in a panic that "the Syrians have hacked my computer!/phone!" Annoying. Sigh.\n\n**edit 2:** [How these sorts of things happen.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/02/20/how-the-syrian-electronic-army-hacked-us-a-detailed-timeline/) (Feb 2014 Forbes event)\n&gt;Early Thursday morning, a Forbes senior executive was woken up by a call from her assistant, saying that she’d be working from home due to a forecast predicting the snowiest day of the year. When she ended the call, the executive saw on her Blackberry that she had just received a bluntly worded email that seemed to have been sent by a reporter at Vice Media, asking her to comment on a Reuters story linked in the message.\n\n&gt;Any other time, she says she would have waited to read the linked story later at the Forbes office. But with the sale of the 96-year-old media company pending, she was on the alert for news. Groggily stepping out of bed, she grabbed her iPad, opened the email in her Forbes webmail page through a shortcut on the device’s homepage and tapped the emailed link.\n\n&gt;In her half-asleep state, she was prompted for her webmail credentials and entered them, thinking her access to the page had timed out. When the link led to a broken url on Reuters’ website, she got dressed and began her snowy commute from Brooklyn to Manhattan without a second thought. “It was so insidious,” she says. “I didn’t know I had been hacked for another two hours.”\n\n&gt;An image of the Syrian flag that was uploaded to Forbes’ WordPress image server when hackers gained access to a super-administrator account.\n\n&gt;In fact, the phishing email had set in motion a two-day cat-and-mouse game with Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) hackers who would deface the Forbes website and backend publishing platform, attempt to post market-moving news, steal a million registered users’ credentials, and briefly offer them for sale before leaking the data online.

Would it be more wrong if the data was stolen from a privately held company?\n\nIf you owned a company and information about your finances, the finances of your employees, product development and release plans were made available to your competitors... you wouldn't have a problem with that? \n\nEveryone assumes Sony will weather this storm, but this exact type of hack could be fatal for many smaller companies. I don't equate this to the privacy rights of individuals, but this is clearly wrong. But you say it's not. Why?
