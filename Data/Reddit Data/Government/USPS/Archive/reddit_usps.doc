I was actually hoping for a discussion rather than you taking the easy way out and C&amp;P your way out of this.\n\nIgnoring the fact that you're kind of proving my point for the kind of agenda that the media has for China, I'm going to do most of the leg work and make my commentary where necessary. I often wish I was paid for doing this kind of stuff.\n\n&gt; China reveals its ability to nuke the US\n\n- Red flag #1: The dailymail\n- Red Flag #2: Revealing your nuclear submarine fleet does not equate to using them or even giving the notion that they had plans to use them. All developed countries have them, and this is China's way of establishing itself as a power in the region. This is what nations do.\n\n&gt; Confident China unveils its secretive nuclear submarine fleet for the first time in four decades\n\n- Red flag #1: same link/story as the above\n\n&gt; Hypersonic arms race: China tests high-speed missile to beat U.S. defenses\n\n- Red flag #1: A heavily biased and opinionated article that does not even hide its attempt its agenda. Strip away the sensationalism and and opinions and all you have is a an article about China testing weapons. Holy shit, stop the presses, I've just got word from Lockheed Martin.\n\n- Red flag #2: The transparency involved in such testing kind of proves China's intent. If they actually decided that they wanted to use those weapons for offensive purposes, do you think they would have allowed the US to have picked up on it, despite knowing that they are actively spied on by them?\n\n&gt; China military unit 'behind prolific hacking'\n\n- Red flag #1: All capable countries operate a militarized cyber warfare group. In fact, numerous other countries are spying and hacking the US (or at least attempting to). But aside from Russia, China is the only one worthwhile to report on.\n\n&gt; Ex-CIA director says Huawei spied for China\n\n- Red flag #1: So a guy who was a director for the CIA and who ran the NSA is calling the kettle black. All without providing any evidence but "don't worry guys, its all back at the office."\n\n&gt; Abe sees World War One echoes in Japan-China tensions\n\n- Red flag #1: Kind of irrelevant to what you're trying to prove, other than the fact that it has Japan and China in the title. Abe is speaking rhetorically of course, since at the present there is no real danger to aggression breaking out.\n\n&gt; Why China's Rise Will Not Be Peaceful\n\n- Red flag #1: This isn't even a news article, but a US-centric paper essentially stating that China won't become a superpower because the US doesn't like peer competition and will stamp them out through proxy wars. This is a really unsettling view.\n\n&gt; The New Cold War: China vs Japan\n\n- Red flag #1: "Lately, it seems that Japanese officials can’t sneeze without incurring the wrath of the Chinese"\n\nThat's all you really need to know about where that article is going and how it will be written.\n\n&gt; China To Build World's Largest Marine Surveillance Ship\n\n-Red flag #1: The dependency on buzzwords to make up for the fact that everyone is freaking out about other aspects of China's fleets.\n\nI would do more, but I have plans for my Saturday and they do not involve me combing through your list of editorials and opinion pieces. Honestly, the speed by which you posted these links and the lack of quality in many of the articles make me suspect your intentions. Your post history is definitely another red flag, anyone can take a gander at that and realise a specific pattern in your comment history. And it certainly does not stop at spreading misleading information about China.\n\nEdit: Actually, it may be silly of me to expect people to actually click on the links that you posted to find out for themselves. This is /r/worldnews afterall.

They've done this many times in the past (hacked the AP Twitter feed in 2013 so their own altered content appears on any news service that pulled articles from the AP twitter feed). \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5LzF8fX.jpg\n\nSocial media sites are as hard to "hack" as the stupidity of the user who failed to choose a complex password or the gullibility of somebody working at a news/media company who willingly gives out their log in information for 3rd party source sites. They (SEA) spend countless hours phishing for passwords from all the news feed companies (create elaborate websites that look like the real thing, then send new alerts to AP, Reuters, etc, with links that take the user to their fake website and then the user tries to enter the proper AP or Reuters user/password info -- at that point SEA now has their real credentials to log into the real AP or Reuters website and post fake news).\n\n\n**edit:** this has turned into a pain in the ass for me. It also effected a few weather apps (PC and mobile), so this morning I'm being bombarded by clients in a panic that "the Syrians have hacked my computer!/phone!" Annoying. Sigh.\n\n**edit 2:** [How these sorts of things happen.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/02/20/how-the-syrian-electronic-army-hacked-us-a-detailed-timeline/) (Feb 2014 Forbes event)\n&gt;Early Thursday morning, a Forbes senior executive was woken up by a call from her assistant, saying that she’d be working from home due to a forecast predicting the snowiest day of the year. When she ended the call, the executive saw on her Blackberry that she had just received a bluntly worded email that seemed to have been sent by a reporter at Vice Media, asking her to comment on a Reuters story linked in the message.\n\n&gt;Any other time, she says she would have waited to read the linked story later at the Forbes office. But with the sale of the 96-year-old media company pending, she was on the alert for news. Groggily stepping out of bed, she grabbed her iPad, opened the email in her Forbes webmail page through a shortcut on the device’s homepage and tapped the emailed link.\n\n&gt;In her half-asleep state, she was prompted for her webmail credentials and entered them, thinking her access to the page had timed out. When the link led to a broken url on Reuters’ website, she got dressed and began her snowy commute from Brooklyn to Manhattan without a second thought. “It was so insidious,” she says. “I didn’t know I had been hacked for another two hours.”\n\n&gt;An image of the Syrian flag that was uploaded to Forbes’ WordPress image server when hackers gained access to a super-administrator account.\n\n&gt;In fact, the phishing email had set in motion a two-day cat-and-mouse game with Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) hackers who would deface the Forbes website and backend publishing platform, attempt to post market-moving news, steal a million registered users’ credentials, and briefly offer them for sale before leaking the data online.

Typical anti-union animus just like the games they're playing with the post office.  read the arguments and just substitute CEO for top 500 and see how it fits.\n\nEDIT: Some different perspective:\n&gt;On its face, Vergara v. California was the case of nine students fighting a practice designed to protect educators' academic freedom that now occasionally entrenches terrible teachers. However, the case was part of a larger shell game orchestrated by one Silicon Valley tech mogul. Students Matter, the non-profit that funded the multi-million dollar suit, is founded and primarily funded by David Welch. . . Students Matter was unique, as an investigation by Capital &amp; Main discovered, because Welch "had virtually no background in education policy or any direct financial stake in the multibillion-dollar, for-profit education and standardized testing industries." . . . However, Welch quickly cozied up to organizations and individuals that work to privatize America's once-great education system:\n\n &gt;   Yet Welch and his nonprofit play a special role among a group of other nonprofits and personalities whose legal actions, school board campaigns, op-eds and overlapping advisory boards suggest a highly synchronized movement devoted to taking control of public education. The David and Heidi Welch Foundation, for example, has given to NewSchools Venture Fund, where Welch has been an "investment partner" and which invests in both charter schools and the cyber-charter industry, and has been linked to the $9 billion-per-year textbook and testing behemoth Pearson. Welch has also supported Michelle Rhee's education-privatizing lobby StudentsFirst, most recently with a $550,000 bequest in 2012.\n\n&gt;    StudentsFirst also turned up on an early list of Students Matter's "advisory committee" that included ardent education privatizers Democrats for Education Reform, Parent Revolution and NewSchools Venture Fund. Both StudentsFirst and NewSchools Venture Fund also appear on a list of Vergara supporters that includes the California Charter Schools Association, along with Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent (and onetime Vergara co-defendant) John Deasy and former Oakland Unified School District superintendent Tony Smith.\n\n&gt;California's education system is in a crisis right now, and it's not because of a few inept teachers being protected from the realities of a free market. Enrollment in California's teacher preparation programs have plummeted 66% in the last decade. Budget cuts continue to make it hard for districts to hire sorely needed teachers following recession-era layoffs. All the while teacher satisfaction with their jobs has taken a dive, making the field less attractive to job seekers.\n\n[Source](http://valleywag.gawker.com/silicon-valley-mogul-financed-california-lawsuit-to-end-1588947329) and there's many more.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I just called my local USPS...There was a hack this week that caused a few system to be taken down. \n\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2014/11/10/usps-hacked/\n\nThe guy i talked to said he would look in on the package personally. \n\nIt said it went on Friday for delivery then there was an update that said there was no update.  
I had to take a few minutes to calm down after reading this, it pissed me off so much, especially since I've been there and I'm so torn.  Anyone who looks through my history can see the nightmare I've been dealing with, but I've also had a great evening (watched the wrestling PPV with friends and family).  Then I read this.  I sit here and think "This is someone who just wanted to be honest about what's going through their brain.  Not dictate a suicide note or anything, but just talk.  Yet, someone doxed them and had the cops involved".  To me, that's seriously screwed up, in more than one way.  \n\nWe see the internet as this place where we can talk with people next door or around the world.  We can exchange ideas, share information, and form bonds.  And most importantly (for this) is that we can find people with similar likes/dislikes/issues.  In this case, we find a community we can be a part of, share our issues and feelings, and not be judged.  That trust was broken last night by whoever doxed this person.  Seriously.  I have came on here and ranted several times, talked about how I wanted to bang my head into a wall or if I walk into my p-doc's office in the mood I'm in, I'd leave in cuffs due to the receptionist.  What have I done?  Tripped over a dollhouse.  Facepalmed on a stupid move.  But nothing that harmed anyone or myself.  I sit here and look at /u/kirbias and I think "That post, just 10 minutes on the phone to vent and talk, have someone reply who's been there, and it would have been fine, or at least they would have made the right moves for themselves."  Instead, someone calls the cops on them and that crap.  I've had it done, and it's embarrassing as hell, both to have to sit in an ER watched by police who think you're gonna try to grab a knife and slice yourself as well as the neighbors who know that you left with cops (for any reason).  Whoever did this, think about that crap.  Think about the fact that /u/kirbias is going to have that ER visit on their record forever.  And think about the fact that it could have been avoided had you stuck your hand out and said "Here, let me help you up".  \n\nAt the same time, I sit here and think "Do I trust this sub anymore?"  My s/n on here is known by my "friends", and what I post isn't hidden info.  They also know that if I talk about killing about 15 receptionists for being idiots, it's just me venting and getting it off my chest (instead of punching a wall or something).  Look  at my history in other subs, the rants I've gone on because people pissed me off doing annoying/stupid things, especially just to get under my skin.  What happens?  I grab a Dew, walk outside, have a smoke, and breathe if the rant didn't help.  But either way, they know I'm not going to go to my doctors tomorrow and go through the window at the receptionist or follow someone down the road, drag them out of a car and beat them with their own steering wheel.  Now, how do I know that someone who knows nothing of me other than a history of rants and a screen name, isn't going to say "Oh, he said he was gonna bang his head into a wall, lets call the cops on him."  It's a serious violation of trust, especially in a community like this.  At the same time, you don't know what their home life is.   This person could have kids, a family, hell, could be 12 years old and have this stigma haunt them forever.  Instead, you just call the cops on something that's not your business.  \n\nLook, I realize whoever did this had /u/kirbias best interest in mind.  However, did you reach out?  Did you say "I'm here, I'll listen, just step back from that ledge and have a smoke with me" kinda thing?  Involuntary commitment isn't a funny or a fun thing.  It's not a "joke".  It's a, pardon my french, fucking nightmare.  I know, I was put in by my own mother AND kept from the one person I just wanted to hug for 2 days, mostly out of spite.  Next time you think about doing this, reach out first.  Seriously.  Don't do this to someone's life, or you could put them over the edge.\n\nMods, sorry for the wall of text, but I would seriously work with some of the other subs (especially the hacking related ones) to kinda say "Look, I know you have their best intentions in mind, but think before you pull the trigger and see if you can maybe unload the gun with them."  Otherwise, this sub, /r/bipolar, and anything else that has to do with mental illness will become ghost towns, just because of the breach of trust.  Seriously.  We're all brothers and sisters in this, regardless of our diagnosis's or symptoms.  We need to be that family, not the family that fights and isn't there.\n\n/u/kirbias, I've been there, especially a lot lately.  I'm not going to be up much longer, but either way, my inbox is always there, both for the experience with the cops/ER/commitment as well as just to talk.  Read my history (ignore the college football rants and some of the wrestling ones, those guys got under my skin BAD), and know that not only are you not alone but that there are people who aren't affiliated with these groups (if you don't trust them to not call the cops) you can still talk to.

Whether anything bad happens with it or not remains to be seen.\n\nEDIT: I want to clarify the USPS has known about the breach for a while but did not actually notify employees/press because the steps to resolve the breach could have been compromised in the process. This is the latest info that they gave us.
