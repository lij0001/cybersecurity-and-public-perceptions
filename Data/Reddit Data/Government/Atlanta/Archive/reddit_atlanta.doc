Let me state exactly what caused me to "go down this path": idiots speaking with complete confidence on subjects they know nothing about that I have direct and relevant experience in. I've seen so much stupidity: "the Sony hack was an inside job, they're saying it was North Korea to start a war", "the DNC wasn't hacked, they're saying it was to distract from the contents of the leaks", "the Russian government is behind the City of Atlanta breach, they're attacking us because Trump will let them get away with it", etc. Whenever something like that comes up, I weigh in because I understand the evidence being presented, I understand the industry terminology, and I am familiar with the general ecosystem.

This could have been dealt with weeks ago. I know it's bad to feed the trolls, but these people pushing the ransomware attacks make a ton of money off of this because their business plan actually works.\n\nAlso, I imagine City of Atlanta is going to have some IT positions open soon. Sounds pretty cushy since they didn't have shit for DR in place. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I'm only guessing that "Augusta keeps coming up" as an option because you work in the tech/cyber field... Augusta is growing to become the Cyber Nexus of the country, and is expecting HUGE growth (especially once Army Cyber Command moves to Ft. Gordon from Ft. Meade, bringing over 5000 familes + all the vendors/contractors that chase the HQ money).\n\nI grew up in Augusta, traveled the world for 10 years, and returned 4 years ago. I'm happy to be back around family again, but we probably wouldn't CHOOSE to retire here. The people that prefer Augusta either (A) gree up here so they like being around family &amp; long-time friends, (B) are mostly "home-bodies" that enjoy getting more value out of the declining dollar [cause it's cheap to live here!], or (C) are outdoorsy -- like to hunt, fish, hike, cycle, run, and or just hangout outside with friends... In other words: nobody chooses Augusta for the culture. Most people who come move to Augusta from large cities are bored to tears because they were used to having "more to do" (i.e., more culture), and they get out of town to Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah, and Charlotte whenever they can.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of the cheap Southern life without being completely deprived of culture, I'd recommend Charlotte, NC. No matter where you live in the Southeast, you will be overwhelmed with the bug density -- They're everywhere down here! That's why so many people prefer to stay indoors, or buy lots of Off spray/candles.
