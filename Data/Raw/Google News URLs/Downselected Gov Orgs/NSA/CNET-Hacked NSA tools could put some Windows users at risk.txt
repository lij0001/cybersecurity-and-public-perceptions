The hacking group known as Shadow Brokers says it has released National Security Agency malware designed for breaking in to Windows computers. The software could make millions of Microsoft users vulnerable to malicious parties.
As reported by CNET sister site ZDNet, the NSA software enables its users to hack into and even control all versions of Windows computers except those running Windows 10 .
Microsoft said the exploits disclosed by Shadow Brokers have already been addressed by previous software updates. A Microsoft representative said "customers with up-to-date software are already protected."
The company has posted more information in a blog post on its website.
The NSA didn't respond to a request for comment.
This isn't the first US intelligence agency to have tools leaked to the public. Just last month, WikiLeaks released techniques it says the CIA used for breaking into phones, computers, cars and smart TVs .
