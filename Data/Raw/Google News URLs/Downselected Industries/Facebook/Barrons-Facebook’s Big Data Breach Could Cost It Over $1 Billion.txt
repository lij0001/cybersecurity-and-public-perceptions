Facebook’s (FB) massive data breach, which raised the ire of at least one federal lawmaker last week, could cost the social-media giant as much as $1.63 billion in fines from regulators in Europe, where privacy laws are more stringent.

The company’s lead European privacy regulator, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, wants more details about the scope of the breach, which exposed the data of at least 50 million user accounts, and the extent to which EU members were impacted.
