As the risk of data breaches are on the rise, so are the number of attacks  and financial impact on American businesses.
For executives at companies experiencing data breaches, the  consequences can be even more dire. It can cost managers their  jobs.
Five months after Target 's  holiday data breach, the retailer's former chairman and chief  executive Gregg Steinhafel stepped down from his more  than $23 million-a-year position. While Steinhafel also faced  criticism for Target's Canadian expansion, the massive breach—which included leaked credit and debit card information for  millions of customers—likely played a role, according to  analysts.
"Gregg  [Steinhafel] led the response to Target's 2013 data breach. He  held himself personally accountable and pledged that Target would  emerge a better company," the company said in a May 5 statement.
Craig Carpenter, a chief strategist at cybersecurity company  AccessData, said the information security community believes the  resignation will "help raise information security to a C-level  [corporate] issue."

Business managers are paying closer attention to information  security because the costs of data leaks only are expanding.
Since last year, data breaches on average have risen 15 percent  to $3.5 million, according to a new study by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, a researcher  on data protection and information security.
The costly damage to a business includes expenses related to  seeking experts' help, the actual company investigation and any  loss of customers. Part of the 15 percent increase can be  attributed to more customer records being stolen.
Here's what corporate executives and business managers need to  learn about data breaches.
Cybersecurity is everyone's issue.
After data breaches, the person who usually takes blame is the  chief information security officer or the chief  information officer, Carpenter said. In the case of Target,  the chief information officer resigned in March before the chief  executive's departure.
The acknowledgement that all senior managers are responsible for data  security is part of the challenge.
A study by cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg  found that just 45 percent of senior management acknowledged they  are responsible for protecting against cyberattacks.
Shawn Henry—cybersecurity expert and a former executive assistant director of the FBI—said companies need to acknowledge every employee is  responsible for cybersecurity, not just the tech guys. "Technology is a piece of the  solution but it's not the sole solution," said Henry, now president of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike  Services.
