McAfee CTO: Target attack was defendable
The cyberattacks that led to the massive data breach at Target last year marked the "coming-of-age" for a black-market service  industry that caters to malicious hackers and identity thieves,  computer security company McAfee Labs said in a quarterly report  Monday.
That industry allowed the thieves to not only buy custom-made  malware for the theft, but also to quickly sell credit card  numbers from 40 million shoppers affected by the breach. The thieves sold the numbers through online back-channels that security experts call the "dark web," the  company said.
"Retailers in general took this as a wake-up call,"  said Mike Fey, chief technology officer at McAfee, on " Squawk on the Street ." "They saw  an essentially off-the-shelf ... piece of malware modified  for a unique environment, which was Target. A lot of retailers  assumed that if they don't have a standard point-of-sale system,  they were somehow safe. And I think Target showed them that's not  the case."

McAfee Labs released its quarterly report on cybersecurity  threats on Monday. The company focused its attention on the dark  web malware industry that fueled the point-of-sale attacks on  Target and other retailers late last year. The high-profile cyberattacks were unsophisticated technologies that identity thieves  bought off the shelf from the cybercrime "service" community,  which customized the software specifically for the attack, McAfee  said.

McAfee researchers discovered that the Target thieves offered  credit card information for sale in batches between 1 million and 4  million numbers, the cybersecurity company said. What's more,  Fey said Target could have defended against the point-of-sale  attacks if it had a cost-effective method of deploying existing  security technology.
"You take a look at the Target attack," Fey said. "That was  defendable by technology that has been around. It didn't require  a new silver bullet"
Last week, Target's chief information  officer resigned as the retailer seeks to overhaul its  security protections.

Key deadline for Target
Charles Koppelman, the former CEO of Martha Stewart Living  Omnimedia and former chairman of Steve Madden, said the massive  data breach at Target appears to remain limited to the retailer. Other large retailers have enlisted help from tech  companies to better protect consumers, he said
"Once the Target issue happened, other retailers are looking into  their systems," Koppelman said. "The big technology companies are  going to benefit from this. They're all going to be ahead of the  curve. This is a Target-centric issue."

Companies should look to shore up their own defenses rather than finding a third-party to house their data, he added. Having a single, industrywide data storage center won't allay concerns about  individual retailers storing consumer's credit card numbers  themselves, for example, Koppelman said. That will just provide a  bigger target for sophisticated identity thieves, he added.
"Every time you look at taking your data and giving it to someone  else to handle, you're opening up another Pandora's box,"  Koppelman said. "At the end of the day if there's going to be one  massive data storage place, we're going to have difficulties with  them of course."
In addition to the cybercrime service community,  McAfee identified the following threats as ones to watch this year:
Mobile malware: McAfee recovered nearly    triple the number of mobile malware samples last year compared with the end of 2012, collecting 2.47    million new samples in 2013—about 744,000 just in the last    quarter.
Ransom-ware: The use of attacks    against computers and companies to hold them for pricey ransoms    has increased significantly in the past year. McAfee doubled    its collection of ransom-ware samples in the fourth quarter of    2013 compared with the final quarter of 2012. The use of such    malicious software drew headlines    last week when social networking website Meetup.com became    locked in a battle with cybercriminals who demanded    $300 to lift an ongoing digital siege on the company's    website.
Suspicious URLs: Be vigilant for    sketchy looking links. McAfee recorded a 70 percent increase in    suspect URLs throughout 2013.
McAfee also called into the question the way Web  service providers authenticate trusted third parties. More and  more malware now comes "signed" by certificate authorities, a  model that brands third-party information providers as safe and  trusted. That means Web users can no longer rely on certificates  as a badge of security on third-party links or software.

McAfee has seen a threefold increase in the number of "malicious  signed binaries"—or malware signed by ceritificate  authorities—in the past year, its report said.
