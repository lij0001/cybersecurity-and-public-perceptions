For Target Chairman and CEO Gregg  Steinhafel, December 15 started out as a normal Sunday.  He was at home, having coffee with his wife. That's when he got  the first call about the cyber security breach at the retailer,  which would to date put the personal information of as many as  110 million customers at risk.
"My heart sunk," Steinhafel reflected, describing his initial  reaction to word of the attack, which had hit Target at the worst  time with the busy holiday shopping season in full-swing and  Christmas just 10 days away.
"It's hard for me to describe the feeling that came over me," he  revealed in a CNBC interview—his first since Target  acknowledged the attack—four days after Steinhafel was  initially informed.

While it's been about a month since Steinhafel learned of the  breach, he said he's "still shaken by it." He said he's had  many "sleepless nights" already, but expects many more because  "we are not going to sleep until we get it right and we regain  the trust of our guest. And we're gonna be better as a result of  this."
He knows his customers are still frustrated, and said that "they  have every right to be."
On December 19, Target first disclosed that as many 40 million  credit and debit cards were compromised between November 27 and  December 15 by malware installed on the company's point of sale  registers.
Steinhafel said Target's first priority was to remove the  malware, which was accomplished by that Sunday evening. "We were  very confident that coming into Monday [Dec. 16], guests could  come to Target and shop with confidence with no risk."
But this past Friday, Target said its investigation found that at  least 70 million customers' personal information was stolen from  its database—including names, mailing addresses, telephone  numbers, and email addresses. Some victims did not shop at Target  during the time of the breach, said the retailer, which expects  some overlap in the two data sets but does not have the exact  numbers yet.

Steinhafel said he's aware of the anger felt by his customers  because he's been getting an unvarnished view of the outcry. "No  one screens my email. So I have read every single email that has  come to me."
He said the emails "run the gamut of emotions" from support of  the way the retailer has handled the situation, to what he  described as some "fairly poorly chosen words to describe Target  and myself."
Target also announced on Friday that it lowered its  fourth-quarter profit forecast, in part due to  weaker-than-expected sales since reports of the cyber-attack  emerged. Steinhafel said that shopping trends as of Friday were  nearly back to normal.
"We have to do everything possible to make it right by every  guest and earn that trust back," Steinhafel vowed.
