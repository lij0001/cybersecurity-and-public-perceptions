Can confirm. Don't work for them. Pay is shit you'll end up spending all you make just to repair your car. Or the stress of losing your job because you fell under a certain rating just because you had a bad customer that treated you like garbage. Just found out about the data breach today that's great... well not like my data isn't already out on the hackers market. \n\nNow i trim cannabis with some of the happiest people in the world. Fuck Uber.

attack included names, email addresses and phone numbers of 50 million Uber riders around the world, the company told Bloomberg on Tuesday. The personal information of about 7 million drivers were accessed as well, including some 600,000 U.S. driver’s license numbers. No Social Security numbers, trip location details or other data were taken, Uber said.\n&gt;\nAt the time of the incident, Uber was negotiating with U.S. regulators investigating separate claims of privacy violations. Uber now says it had a legal obligation to report the hack to regulators and to drivers whose license numbers were taken. Instead, the company paid hackers $100,000 to delete the data and keep the breach quiet.\n

                           &gt; At the time of the incident, Uber was negotiating with U.S. regulators investigating separate claims of privacy violations. Uber now says it had a legal obligation to report the hack to regulators and to drivers whose license numbers were taken. Instead, the company paid hackers $100,000 to delete the data and keep the breach quiet. Uber said it believes the information was never used but declined to disclose the identities of the attackers.\n\nHoly shit wtf

hacked](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/22/technology/uber-hack-consequences-cover-up/index.html), which [exposed the data from 57 million users and drivers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-hacked-data-for-57-million-people-exposed/), **and** [didn't tell anyone for a year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-22/uber-hack-shows-vulnerability-of-software-code-sharing-services), **AND** [paid the hackers $100,000 hoping the data was destroyed](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/21/uber-data-hack-cyber-attack).\n\nGood job Uber.\n\nNot saying Uber doesn't have a good solution to the taxi service sucking, just that

Lyft is much better in this respect. Uber has specifically said that as soon as they can replace all of their drivers with automated cars they will. Also lyft pays the drivers daily, uber weekly. \n\nFinally Uber has done some SERIOUSLY sketchy shit in the past. Like the "Uber ambassadors program" (this was when they were still gaining popularity) where they gave burner cell phones to people in cities and had them book taxis and lyft and make them wait out front for as long as they could then cancel it. \n\nThen there's the massive hack they didn't disclose for like a year. The sexual harassment shit. I could go on and on. \n\nUber's upper echelon is full of scumbags with Travis Kalanick at the epicenter. \n\n

It's just come out that they suffered a major data breach over a year ago, with the details of millions of customers stolen, which they hid and even went so far as to pay a, $100,000 random for the details to be destroyed. They won't tell their customers if they are affected, or even confirm the total number affected.

                                                       I've caught two taxis in my lifetime. First time the driver told me about all the women he'd rooted and lectured me for not having a mistress. Second time the driver told me how he used to hack people up with a machete back in his home country.\n\nI'm not silly enough to think my limited experience is indicative of the taxi industry as a whole. However I'd have to have a pretty rotten experience in an Uber to top my two in a Swan Taxi.

My first response was to find and seal the breach. My second was to notify everyone who could possibly have been affected. My third was to research where the company stood legally. It was a very busy week.\n\nFuck Equifax, Uber and others who try to pretend nothing happened and hope nobody notices.

that almost all businesses are vitally dependent on finding ways to manipulate human behavior. Charlie Munger talked about this extensively in his various essays and regards psychology as perhaps the most universally essential discipline for just about any endeavor.\n\nSo the tradeoff isn't so much white hat/black hat as it is 'generate paltry/no ROI but feel morally superior'/'hack the system and get wealthy'.\n\nAlmost every large, successful company had to skirt the rules and/or ethics to get where they are. Uber exploited the 1099 loophole to abusively underpay workers and then actively broke the law in various cities around the world. Literally every online platform has to get its users addicted (including Reddit). Microsoft was at one point a monopoly. Google has a more comprehensive data fingerprint of you than the NSA. Coca-cola sells poison. Big meat injects your food with all kinds of sh*t to make it plumper and cheaper. Wall Street banks have accounting standards to factor in the damages they know they have to incur because their business model is the effective arbitraging of criminality at scale. Even the Girl Scouts is run by corporate slugs weaponizing the innocence of little girls.\n\nNobody's clean. In the grand scope of it, black hatting your way to a popular IG account is peanuts next to the other stuff that goes down at the top. This is the world we live in. You either adapt or you don't play the game. But the idealistic middle ground is where fools go to die.

information, credit card information, or identity information after the hacking that happened with 57 million user and driver data being stolen. Bad enough that it was stolen, [Uber PAID off the hackers $100k in hush money to hide it from users](http://techgenix.com/uber-data-breach/).\nNO THANKS.

company that tried to shove sexual harassment under the rug.  \n\nThey paid hackers who promised them to delete the data they stole, and then didn't report it or disclose it to shareholders.  \n\nThis is also the same company that until recently refused to release how many Canadians were affected by the hack but did so today and the number is over 800k people!  \n\nThey ran operation grey ball to avert being caught by authorities in cities that were trying to regulate the use of their services.

                                    We have laws against failing to disclose data breaches, and these laws carry civil penalties. This suit is the city's attempt to enforce its laws against Uber, a company which allegedly broke them. What would you have the city do when a company breaks the law? Not enforce it? Do you think there should be different or harsher penalties when companies fail to secure their customers' data? If so, I agree, but that doesn't mean that the city should decline to enforce the current laws. \n\nAlso, if you experience any financial or material damage from the Uber data breach, you are well within your rights to sue Uber yourself or join a class action lawsuit.

In WD1, enemy detection mechanics are far more natural and balanced. If you get spotted, you have a short window of opportunity to take the enemy down before they alert the others by yelling out or shooting at you. They also react realistically to visual and audio stims. You won’t be easily spotted if one of your ass hairs is sticking out from behind a car, 20 ft away from someone. Distant gun fire will also alert enemies, but won’t cause them to instantly know where you are. They won’t even know it was you who did it, unless they see you with a weapon.\n\nMeanwhile in WD2, the instant you get spotted by an enemy, all of his buddies (and even dogs) within a half mile radius will instantly know where you are, and will rush right to you. Their detection also feels broken. Enemies in WD2 will not only spot your ass hair sticking out from behind a car at 20 ft away, but at 50 ft away. They will also know exactly where a distant gun shot came from, and will know it was you who caused it even if you are unarmed.\n\nLet’s also not forget the various easy buttons that make stealth in WD2 worthless. Are you being spotted by one person? Hack that person to force them to stare at their phone. Are you being spotted by multiple people? Hack everyone in the area at the same time to make them all stare at their phones. It’s ridiculous. Hell, it can even get you out of a firefight.\n\nIn WD1, those easy buttons were limited to specific people. And if you used it, they didn’t become completely blind like they do in WD2. You could still be detected if you got too close.\n\nAs for shooting: the sound effects, recoil effects, and partcle effects are all inferior in WD2. I also feel like the zoomed out camera view while aiming in WD2 contributes to an overall floaty feeling that doesn’t exist in WD1.\n\nShooting was actually so bad at launch that Ubisoft had to improve how it felt it in a patch. Let that sink in. Sadly though, it’s still not as good as it was in WD1.\n\nDriving is worse in WD2 if only because of how buggy are. It’s no masterpiece in WD1, but it’s truly all over the place in WD2. Physics between different cars are very inconsistent, and outright broken feeling sometimes. Some examples:\n\n• The Vessel, which reminds me alot of a 90s oldsmobile, is extremely slow. However, the 60s beetle thing is one of the faster vehicles in the game.\n\n• Some cars lose speed unnaturally quickly when you let off the gas, and others can coast halfway through the city even if they get destroyed.\n\n• Some vehicles (particularly the Relegator box truck) can barely reverse. They just spin their tires like crazy if you make the attempt. Other vehicles, like the VW bus, can accelerate twice as fast in reverse as they can going forward.\n\n• Some cars have really slow steering. Others, like the el camino thing, will fly off the road with the slightest tap of input.\n\n• The quad bike\n\nThe physics in WD1 are at least consistent, and feel fluid enough on flat surfaces. My only real complaint with them is that cars feel very stiff on uneven surfaces. This is because they barely seem to rotate if any of their wheels are off the ground.\n\nMovement is also worse, imo... and for one very specific reason. The game prevents you from jumping off of high places, even if you will survive the fall. I lost count of how many times this ridiculous mechanic got me killed in multiplayer.\n\n“Oh shit, he sees me. Better jump off this roof. Come on Marcus, go... GO... **GO!!!** Aaaand I’m dead.”\n\n&gt;As for the after game, I dropped the game the moment I finished the story, the side activities was boring and the city had nothing to offer, while San fracinco is a magnificent place to take a walk, parkour on the monuments and it also have side activities.\n\nAside from multiplayer, all you can really do after the story is “take a walk”. At least WD1 actually has side activities. The only thing WD2 has is the Uber app.\n\nIn WD1, you can interect with NPCs in more ways. You can play poker, chess, and even the classic “guess where the ball is” game. You can stop a variety of crimes in WD1 too, and there are mechanics built around doing so. In WD2, all you can do in that regard is observe someone stealing a car or doing a driveby. You could shoot them to stop them, but there is no reputation/skill bonus for doing so.\n\nAs for parkouring around the city? Sure, you can still do that in WD2. However, WD1 has time trials in several places around the city specifically to parkour around in. If those events arent good enough for you, you can even create your own, and download some from others.\n\nAnd of course, if you get bored of playing as Aiden... why not play as a giant mechanical spider and cause chaos? The game even gives you objectives and scores to beat while you do it.

Did the Rebellion run out of B wings or something? The bombers are not only slower and clunkier than B Wings, but are so lightly armored that just one of them blowing up sets off a chain reaction that wipes the whole fleet out from just shrapnel.\n\nThose bombers carried far more ordinance than any B, Y, X or any other alphabet letter you wanna throw in there and they were no more delicate than any other small ship.\n\n&gt;* Starships suddenly run on gas/fumes which was never seen before as far as I know. Even if there were gas powered ships before, that doesn't explain why they ran out of fuel after a single jump considering that some battles last for days or weeks at a time.\n\nFueling pipes have been seen often through the previous 7 films, they've just never really looked at the whole system in detail. In Star Trek it's a very relevant aspect of the universe from the start, it just wasn't addressed really in SW explicitly. Cloud City's refinery operations I vaguely remember as having something to do with fuel of some kind though in the EU.\n\nAnd they've been running from the First Order, Resistance controlled refueling stations would be one of the main targets, destroy support channels and then go after the main force, it's tactics 101\n\n&gt;* Finn and Rosie O Donnel steal a shuttle and jump into hyperspace super quickly. why didn't the rest of the rebellion do the same? \n\nBecause they were being tracked through hyperspace by the big sizzling conduit that Finn and Rose almost got to...it was the whole point of the mission\n\n&gt;* If one ship is able to destroy an entire fleet by simply ramming them, why has no one in the past done so? \n\nA) the ship doing the hyperspace ramming would need to be of sufficient size to cause enough critical damage\n\nB) do you think flag ships grow on trees? No, this isn't the Vong war, ships need to be built and it goes back to the issue of supply chains in war\n\n&gt;* If the deflector shields of the capital ships can't be penetrated by the star destroyers, why is a single fighter able to blow up the command deck, and why did they not continue doing so after it clearly worked the first time? \n\nThere's an explanation, again I want to say it was Star Trek but it could be another sci fi series where shields are utilised...a blaster has energy, we'll say it's electricity for piggy, but a fighter isn't the type of substance the shield is built to fight against. \n\nNow, in ST you've several types of shields and defensive ship shields let absolutely nothing in, not even ships of a small size, similar to the Dreadnaughts shields that need to have a slicer hack into to make a gap. \n\nBut all encompassing shields are energy hogs, if you've a finite fuel supply then a complete defensive shield is not the way to go, you defend against what would do the maximum damage and hope your CAP or emergency fighter squadrons deployed can keep smaller fighters at bay.\n\nThe Dreadnaught is a very specifically designed war ship, with the different style of shielding, the monster weapons and mostly unseen uber monster power source, probably some variation on the self contained warp cores of ST.\n\nAnd, the Rebellion/Resistance ships have always been more passive capital ships with fighter supports for defence if needed but not offensive ships, again speaking to the difference on agenda's.\n\nI think I've gone on enough about shields and war footing philosophies now\n

                                     I can't see Uber surviving.  They are facing legal action in many of their large markets outside of the US and that massive data breach means they are not a fit and proper company.\n\nThere are alternatives who could easily swoop in and steal Uber's lunch.
