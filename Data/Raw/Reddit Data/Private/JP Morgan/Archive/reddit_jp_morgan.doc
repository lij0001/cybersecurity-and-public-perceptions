The Titanic was owned by JP Morgan (he financed White Star Line). JP Morgan and his three wealthy cohorts (all supporting the creation of the Fed) cancelled last minute before the maiden voyage. That would be: Milton Snavely Hershey (the other financier of White Star Line), Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, and Henry Clay Frick.\n\nWho was on the Titantic and subsequently died? Three of the wealthiest men at the time, all against the creation of the Fed. That would be John Astor (also Nikola Tesla's backer), Benjamin Guggenheim, and Isidor Straus (who was also a representative).\n\nThe Fed passed in 1913 uncontested. It was also a double whammy, JP Morgan got to claim insurance on the ship. \n\nIf you look at the history of the Titanic and the Olympic (sister ships), there's a good chance they swapped the names once the Olympic had a run-in with the RMS Hawke. White Star was eventually found at-fault for the collision, they were unable to claim insurance on the damaged Olympic. \n\nBeing that the Titanic was not completed just yet, they could not afford both ships to be out of service for long. When the Titanic was completed, they branded it as the "Olympic" and sent it out to make money once again. Meanwhile, the damaged original Olympic was in the dock getting patched up and rebranded as the "Titanic".\n\nWhy would they do such a thing? First and foremost, it would allow JP Morgan to collect insurance on a damaged ship (the Olympic that had run into the RMS Hawke). Secondly, it was structurally weakened, making it an easy ship to sink. The hull was quickly patched up but it still was far from its original strength (hence why the Titanic only travelled at half speed compared to the Olympic).\n\nThere's still a big debate on whether they actually hit an iceberg or if it was a smaller ship with its lights off. Either way, the hull was damaged and the impact was enough to breach it.\n\nI'm sure this comes off as a lot of hot air, but if you do some research the dots start to connect. Also for those into numerology, here's the day it set sail: May 31st 1**911**.
