I don't know - my town is dealing with a Colonial pipeline spill making its way to the water table, and we still don't have gas because their billing system was hacked - and I'm thinking that it would be smarter to focus on 21st century issues - cyber security , climate change - but all I hear from Republicans is Dr. Seuss and the terror of trans children. \n\nSeriously?

They don't entertain any thoughts past item 1. No, seriously. I live in AZ and they just make up reality as they go. \n\nThe really great thing about being conservative (especially in AZ) is that if you don't like the sound of anything grounded in reality or logic, you just handwave it away and say "no, fake news" ...and, like magic, in their mind it's not real anymore. \n\nThe second you try to move past item 1 on that list, they simply use the power of whataboutism or saying something to the effect of "well, that's just your opinion. You need to look up the facts". That's all there is to it. \n\nA coworker mentioned that the Colonial oil pipeline hack was a sign of Bidens weakness and how he's responsible for the worst data breach in history. I mentioned that the worst American intelligence data breach actually was discovered in December, and had been going on for months (at least) under Trump's watch, and I even showed her the Google result of it being reported on numerous news outlets...and she simply said "I don't believe the MSM. I get my facts from credible news sources", and refused to tell me what those sources were. That was the end of the conversation.

They phished someone in accounting, and their billing system was locked. Colonial responded by shutting the pipeline down because they couldn't properly bill clients while locked out of their billing system. So yeah, the idea that an idiot in payments receivable opened a phishing email is pretty believable. The hackers don't have to be particularly clever to send a phishing email to random addresses at random companies. The outsized impact was entirely due to choices made by Colonial.

They only asked for $5 million from Colonial...that is pocket change for a pipeline that size.  When your attack has the potential to cause a national emergency and the president has to be briefed, all of a sudden the CIA is involved and they have all kinds of resources to find you.  A little different than an attack on some random company that is just gonna lose some money.

Your power plant can be entirely air gapped but if some associated "soft" system gets penetrated like billing or HR or sales a company could be leveraged into shutting down operations.\n\nCompanies don't take cyber security seriously and it shows - if something can be considered critical to the national infrastructure are there not laws/regulations about how they keep themselves secure?

It follows a string of cyber attacks that panicked consumers and led President Biden to warn Russia that it needed to take “decisive action” against the criminal networks.\n\n&gt; How ransomware attacks are affecting consumers\n\n&gt; “Today we turned the tables on DarkSide,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said, announcing the recovery on Monday afternoon. “The Department of Justice has found and recaptured the majority of the ransom” in the wake of last month’s attack.\n\n&gt; Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount told The Wall Street Journal last month that the firm paid $4.4 million in ransom.\n\n&gt; “I know that’s a highly controversial decision,” he said. “ … But it was the right thing to do for the country.”

And millions of sheep haven't woken up to it yet. And when they do, if ever they do, it will be on the edge of being too late.\n\nNext steps from the Davos elite will be, and could be... \n\nA financial collapse. The release of another manmade virus. A global cyberattack on critical infrastructure. As for the latter, they've just tested and signalled that via the recent cyber attacks on the Colonial Pipeline and JBS.

It's back down to being below the national average, which (obviously) includes states that weren't impacted by the pipeline hack.  \n\n\nMost people waited in a line and paid extra just one time. One trip to the gas station was inconvenienced.  \n\n\nThe ransomware attack did not shut off the gas. Colonial decided to do that because they weren't sure they'd be able to bill customers properly. Their profits came before the needs of all the people in the entire Southeastern United States.  \n\n\nExperts warned that Trump was weakening national Cybersecurity in a number of ways—notably by emboldening Russia. DarkSide was a Russian crime group (they have since disappeared), and there are suspicions that it had connections to the Russian government (who seem the most likely candidates for shutting them down).  \n\n\nIronically (and hilariously), DarkSide released this statement after they saw what was happening in the US: "Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society. From today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.”  \n\n\nIn other words, a bunch of Russian hackers care more about the average Joe in the Southeastern US than Trump and good ol' American businesses do.

People panicked and immediately started buying up all the gas, causing a gas shortage.  People went so far as to fill up plastic bags with gasoline.

With the Colonial Pipeline hack and recently the Meat supplier cybersecurity business is picking up. BB got the cybersecurity contract with the Government of Canada since last earnings. Also the upcoming patent sale will add great news. The earnings is a chance for BB to shine. 🚀💎🖐

The hackers didn't have to do any "hacking" to execute their breach. They just walked in the metaphorical front door and sat in the living room for 18 months without anybody knowing they were there.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, which abruptly stoppered the flow of fuel through one of the country's most important arteries, didn't happen because the hackers got access to the systems that actually control the pipeline. Instead, the hackers simply targeted the company's business systems, which had wide open connections to the control systems.

The hack didn't affect the actual operation of the pipeline. Colonial shut the pipeline down voluntarily because their billing system was affected....

I feel like that's myopic and the scope needs to broaden to include agriculture, transportation, and other sectors. \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/02/cybersecurity-202-meat-industry-is-latest-be-thrown-into-chaos-by-ransomware/\n\n&gt; The attack against Brazil-based JBS has halted production at all the company’s U.S. meat processing facilities and slaughterhouses across Australia, shutting down about one-fifth of U.S. beef production, Hamza Shaban reports. JBS said it expects to have sufficiently recovered to have most plants operational today, but the shutdown is still threatening a temporary surge in beef and pork prices and roiling an industry already battered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThat's just the meat industry. Wouldn't really be shocked if we see another attack on a key industry within the next couple months/weeks.

Goddamn bitcoin.\n\nReal question is, how did the FBI recover 64 of 75 bitcoins? I've seen a lot of explanations flying around, but the fact that 11 eluded their grasp is the weird bit.\n\nThe US government probably has a tool to de-anonymize bitcoin holders (this was proven possible with independent research) because we have a tendency to have tool to break anything or we created what everyone is using and no one bothered to research it ahead of time.

Elon saying $TSLA no longer accepting it. China not accepting it.  The biggest ding, in my opinion is the Colonial Pipeline hack and the ransom that it collected in $BTC. It gives Yellen and others more and more ammo to give credence to the fact it is used as black market currency and for nefarious activities.

You are afforded a laissez-faire freedom and liberty to play all sorts of games without having to worry too much about getting shut down by some nasty government agents – at least as long as you are not breaking too many laws. \n\nThat is – until you mess with their National Security. Then you're gonna have a bad time. A really, really bad, Guantanamo Bay extrajudicial detention type of a bad time.\n\nI always thought Bitcoin and the whole crypto casino game was tolerated in the large scheme of things as long as it didn't pose an demonstrable US national security threat. This might have now ended with the Colonial Pipeline hack last month, when some trigger happy hackers brought down the fuel distribution across the entire East Coast just to extract some Bitcoin.\n\nOh well. I guess it's all good for Bitcoin.

Also people focus on the Elon tweet, but ignore that a lot of things happened at the same time. Not only did Elon start to back pedal, but also China threatened to ban bitcoin for the 100th time, Biden said he wanted to crack down on transactions over 10K, the colonial pipeline hack that caused a panic requested a bitcoin ransom, and I thought there was something from Japan but can't remember anymore.\n\nAlso Bitcoin had been on an incredible tear and not had a real pullback in about a year.\n\nNow in addition to everything above, there were a bunch of Elon fanboys that bought Bitcoin because of him, that most probably sold because of him. So they sold off which started a downward pressure, which caused other people to panic and sell.\n\nAt the end of the day Elon himself did not cause a 40% drop, he was one of the factors that did. At the end of the day the real drop was caused by scared people taking profits or cutting losses.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        That’s part of it. You also have the fact that production slowed down during lockdowns and hasn’t ramped up along with the recent CDC guidelines. Everyone is starting to return to work. Summers are also historically the highest prices for fuel/oil etc + higher demands on electrical grids. \n\nPlus, my tinfoil hat take as an IT manager, the Colonial Pipeline situation hasn’t sat easy with me. There’s two thoughts here:\n\nA) there’s no way the eastern seaboard is this vulnerable to a hack without checks and balances in your enterprise architecture… something else I think is happening without our knowledge\n\nB) if it IS that vulnerable, oh boy, it’ll happen again

But the business system was critical to their total operation; without the order system working, they didn't know who to deliver how much to and what the price would be and whether they'd get paid.

The government tho is party of the NATO alliance, so it’s possible but not holding my breath on that to occur.

But what stuck out to me was the idea of the current industry focus on responding to a cyber threat versus BB's focus on preventing cyber threats from happening. This is definitely an edge and this company needs to do better at **COMMUNICATING** and **MARKETING** this. This is their shtick. Luckily for BB, Colonial Pipeline and JBS got fucked in the ass by the ransomware gangs and now companies will try to avoid this situation and will look towards preventative measures rather than just buying Bitcoin. I would love to see BB go all out on marketing to let people know that they're still alive and not just a bottom-of-the-barrel meme stock that makes diamond handers feel like they they wanna be paper handers after this sideways week. The company will then be able to increase revenue and convince non-apes who are actually making financially prudent investment decisions to go in.

Full access to the power grid for control and monitoring, full access to critical banking systems, full access to telecommunication platforms etc. You would have to be a complete fool to believe any aspect of this Colonial Pipeline "hack", it's all bullshit. FBI counterintel division did the entire operation, held Colonial Pipeline hostage and then with the FBI's domestic counterparts saving the day by rescuing the bounty they sent to their own BTC recipient. Laughable joke\n\nThe only digital currencies that the feds want to break are the decentralized  platforms they don't control such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero. They without question are pushing for a Federal Reserve-maintained centralized blockchain where they can see and analyze all monetary transactions. Their wet dream, all they have to do is keep attacking the United States of America, funded by U.S. tax dollars and funny money printed by the Federal Reserve, in order to accomplish it.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation are the literal terrorists in this scenario, off budget FBI counterintel and with domestic FBI covering their counterintel division's tracks by way of the resulting U.S. domestic FBI investigation.\n\nThesis, antithesis, synthesis.

First off the colonial pipeline is a private for-profit corporation that was hacked and that’s what cut off the supply of gas. Important to note that the hack did not actually stop the physical/mechanical transport of the gas in the pipeline it only stopped their ability to bill for the gas they were moving, they shut down the pipeline To protect their profits.\nThis is a company that got tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks through the Trump tax cuts and decided to issue stock buybacks and give raises to their executives instead of raising wages, implementing green technology, or hardening their cyber security measures to prevent things like this from happening…\n\nWhat the fuck any of that has to do with a president who has only been in office for four months is beyond me.

The FBI didn’t “hack” the coins, they just called whoever managed the wallet and asked to have them transferred.\n\nIt’s a perfect example of “not your keys, not your coins”

Plus the attackers may be sanctioned people/organizations/nation-states so the money isn't going to a good cause. \n\nOn the other hand, what is a business supposed to do when they get caught with their pants down? What if it's a hospital and people's lives are at risk? What if it's a company that supports critical infrastructure (eg colonial pipeline) and the hack is causing real world problems?\n\nCurious to hear what you think.

I'm like, do you remember the Colonial Pipeline hack and shutdown combined with panic buying in the South East? And that everyone's returning to work after the pandemic and now driving more? And that it's almost Memorial Day which signals the start of the driving season?\n\nBlame Trump for not 'doing cyber' well, and for a pathetic and uncoordinated vaccine roll out that Biden had to fix. But you can blame Biden for the start of summer, dude can move planets.

The specter of hours-long waits in lines to fill up with gas has only enhanced the parallel. [Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/biden-s-gop-foes-pounce-on-inflation-fear-to-fight-spending-plan)\n\nMost of the increases in cost of living/housing/gas etc that have occurred under Biden have been tolerable. I don’t know at what point they become intolerable and people riot at the capital to “overthrow” an “oppressive” presidency.

The hack targeted their billing system. The hackers just had to find a way to shut down the flow of money and the pipeline operators shut down the flow of oil themselves.
The entity from The Chani Project had mentioned that we use words in the wrong way and it would be better to use pictures, like Egyptian hieroglyphs.  My interpretation, languages we use today, entrain the mind as everything is about what has happened and what may happen. The news media uses this constantly to evoke a state of fear.  This keeps people from being in the present moment. The mind constantly runs, and is reinforced by the way our lives operate with the constant barrage of news and digital notifications from our phones. \n\nThe Chani project has also been written off many times as larp failure, as a lot of the predictions didn’t seem to happen.  One of the things was about “15 May” which over the years people were disappointed that every May 15th nothing happened. 5/2015 another let down.\n\nOne of the things the entity said that on 15 May, oil gets a very big sickness, can no longer use. When you read something like that, it’s easy to assume the prediction means some crazy worldwide calamity and oil will never be used again.\n\nBut then we had the colonial pipeline hack in that 15 May timeframe. Where oil production was halted, the corporate side computer systems were “sick” with ransomware, but it was all addressed and operations returned to normal.  But there was also other predictions about oil and radiation and US can no longer afford oil.\n\nWhat else the entity mentions are things like their timeline merging into our timeline. People attacking the Capitol. Big sickness before 15 May (covid). Deaths of many prominent leaders, Cheney by 15 June. That’s a few days away. If he dies within the next few days, that would lend some credence to the entity and the predictions. Coinciding with all the UAP talk, this /r sub, it would be good to read up on the entity either way. \n\nhttps://www.spiritualforums.com/vb/showthread.php?t=128261

That Colonial pipeline should be a wake up call, but it wont... hackers damn near shut down the whole east coast... and they got paid 4 or 5 million dollars in ransom. That type of shit can be repeated everywhere. Our cyber security is pathetic. \n\nBoots on ground will always win a full scale conflict but full scale conflict is largely avoidable if half a country can be crippled by hacking one pipeline.
