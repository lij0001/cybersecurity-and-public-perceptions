Couple things that the article doesn't mention.  The breach wasn't on the physical PoS terminal, it was on the server that processes the transactions.  This would explain why they can't pin point it to a specific store or location, the data breach took place across the country in no obvious pattern.  Only credit cards have been stolen, debit have not because they go through a different process for verification and would not have gone through the infected server.\n\n\nThis is VERY common, more so than anyone realizes.  ATM's are the easiest because they aren't physically monitored and the attackers can be in close proximity to them.  Most of them are attacked via bluetooth transmitter implanted in the card readers.  Getting into the PoS terminal is a bit more complicated because you need to impersonate an employee of the company that maintains the terminals(Usually).\n\nKeep an eye on your accounts if you have shopped at a target and notify your bank if anything suspicious comes up.\n\nSource - Family member works in the business and was on the conference call between Target and Secret Service\n\nEdit: [Here is a link with some good ideas if you think your card could have been compromised](http://www.nbcnews.com/business/use-your-credit-card-target-heres-what-do-if-your-2D11775079)

These cyber criminals targeted FOUR multibillion gaming corporations. All those Lulzec and Anon guys targeted small fry compared to what these retarded DDOSers did (only big thing they did was target US government websites). Expect to see Scotland Yard and FBI investigations for this and in about 6-7 months it will be on the news that they got caught.\n\nPeople need to distinguish between hackers and DDOSers because one requires talent and exceptional intelligence and the other can be done by anyone.

                                                              As Target continues to audit their network it wouldn't be surprising if further breaches are discovered. It's already apparent that not only were CDE servers compromised with the initially reported breach, but this additional batch of client data would have come from other servers. \n\nNot only were multiple servers breached but they were breached for a long period of time without notice. This shows a severe impairment of Target's security infrastructure, policies and procedures. It's no wonder they're hiring a new security chief. \n\nTo me one big question is whether the principal failures are in the implementation of security or if the actual security stance of the corporation is deficient. If the former, this can be corrected, albeit through getting the right people in place and spending a good bit of money. If it's the latter, then without a major change at the top of the Target foodchain (and a true commitment to a corporate culture that promotes information security as a high priority) there is little chance of fixing things. Either way the organization has suffered a significant harm to its PR and is going to have its work cut out in damage control. \n\nSource: former infosec guy with card processing experience

          I've had hackusations before and I'm not even that good. I think the big part of the problem is just that most players are actually exceptionally bad and thus anything not terrible comes off as impossible to them. Just look at the prevalence of terrible sensors in "gaming" mice because they give high CPI.\n\nAs for these videos, LG makes it tough to pick as someone with good LG is going to move in VERY similar ways to an aimbotter anyway, especially if it's only an "assist" instead of a proper bot. I'm going to throw my hat in with [the hack being vid](#s "2"), but thats a pretty shaky hunch at best, based almost entirely on [the way he target switched on the stairs](/spoiler).

getting. The people quoted saying things in the article like that they will never shop there again or not to shop at target because you will \nbecome a Target are woefully behind the times and frankly, for lack of a better word, stupid. Target, like most companies now, have an incredibly sophisticated security network. They spend a fortune on improving security. What people don't realize is what a formidable opponent cyber criminals are. These are guys who could accomplish great things if they put in the same effort to good causes. The problem is that to avoid situations like this, companies like Target have to be right 100% of the time. Meanwhile, the criminals have to be right once. This just happens to be an attack that worked, but for every one of these that get through Target probably stops thousands. These attacks are a lot more common and prevalent than the general public understands.

What happened is that some bureaucrat, or a group of them, got their panties in a bunch and decided to enforce some bullshit regulation that is normally honoured more in the breach than the observance.\n\nThe Mexican TIP is another pointless pain-in-the-ass regulation levied upon boaters to no purpose except to try to demonstrate that the government is in control, even though they are not. The amount of money it brings in is a miniscule fraction of what US and Canadian boaters pump into the local economy every day. Even if you account for hit-and-miss tax collection in Mexico, the government gets more money from what boaters spend than they collect directly through the TIP, by far.\n\nUnfortunately, some asshole always decides that there have to be rules and forms and crap and implements something like the TIP to foil and discourage tourism and the free flow of cash into the hands of ordinary Mexicans from wealthy tourists. They have to get greedy and use their power to fuck things up; it is human nature.\n\nThe real problem, though, is not the seventy bucks for the TIP. It's the eighty seven rules that go along with it to make your life miserable and allow whatever little petty dictator is sitting behind the desk when you have to get it, or renew it, to fuck you over. This is done purely so some little Mexican asshat official with a jumped-up ego and a grade 3 education can convince himself (yes, him, invariably) that he is better than you, because he has power over you, and that makes him a man.\n\nSo some boaters just say "fuck it" and they don't bother to drop everything and fly back to Mexico every year at the precise moment the TIP expires, so they can stand in line at some hot little squalid office. Or else they can't renew it for one of the eighty-seven reasons that may or may not have been written into the law by other bureaucrats with a grade 3 education, but who never really thought about the impact their regulations might have on the local economies of thousands of ports in the unlikely event that they were ever enforced. Probably because they never expected them to be enforced--they're just going through the motions to gratify their little egos like every other parasite in that craphole of a country.\n\nAnd then some asshat gets the idea that the laws of Mexico are being ignored. And you can't do that, because that would be disrespecting Mexico, and that would mean that the self-important asshat is less of a man. So they get up a big raid with guns and uniforms and all that macho shit to show that you can't disrespect Mexico, because we're men, and we're better than you.\n\nIt happens elsewhere, too. Anywhere that officialdom can find an easy target because someone just wants to relax and enjoy their retirement on a boat. In Belguim, they apparently fine you for coming into the country with the wrong colour fuel in your tanks. In America, the SWAT team clears out the anchorage because the city has decided to install mooring balls.\n\nIn summary, the people who do these things can be classified on two axes: the asshole axis and the idiot axis. A military-style raid on grandma and grampa's Hunter 45 scores high on both axes.\n\n\n\n\n

                    Target offers 5% off for card holders. I don't use the credit card, but use their debit card version. I can still get cash back, just as if I used my debit card.\n\nNo annual fee, no interest, just a simple 5% off. There is just no reason not to do it. During this past weekend after their breach you got 10% off as a normal customer, then your 5% off applied to that.\n\nIt depends on the retailer I think, but some of them there are 0 reasons not to do it and only benefits. \n\nSome people try to get rewards/cash back on any/all expenses they do in their normal life. If you pay your balances off in full each month, or use the debit version, this is only a positive. \n\n

                  Had shopped at Target during the breach window, and last night had attempted fraud on my debit card. My bank caught it instantly, voided the charge, and re-issued a new card. I'm actually pretty pleased with how painless the experience was in contrast to past security issues.

At Dawson’s hand signal, Elario blew the charges, and the door fell outward. \n\nInstantly, Dawson was through the doorway and scanning, left, right, left again, as Elario moved to his right and Godfried came up the rear, scanning along the compound wall.  \n\n“Looks clear still – no movement,” came the whispered call from Burke, in overwatch in his harness atop the tower wall. \n\n“Check, moving in,” Dawson replied, signaling Elario and Godfried toward the smaller of the two buildings. Intel had not been able to pin down which building the target would be in, only that the target would be the only one at the site on this particular morning; Dawson picked this one because it appeared to be arranged more for sleeping. The larger structure, with its chimney and assortment of boxes and crates outside, might be a communal kitchen and storehouse.  \n\nElario moved silently to the right and around the small building to take up position in the rear. Burke would have a clear view of the left, and Gottfried, to his right, could cover that side. Dawson slowly approached the door, senses alert for noise or movement, and paused just outside the door, listening. Then he slowly put his ear to the door, keeping an eye on Gottfried for a possible danger signal. No noise from within. Taking a step back, Dawson keyed his throat mic, said “Breaching,” then raised his booted foot and kicked the flimsy-looking door just to the right of the lock. \n\nAs he’d expected, the door gave instantly, swinging into the building’s darkened interior, and Dawson followed in a split second, carbine raised as he scanned the room. He felt Gottfried slip in behind him and head to the right. \n\nIn the greenish glow of his NVD, Dawson saw that the building’s two small windows had been boarded up from the inside, and that the interior of the building was empty, its hard dirt floors swept clean, except for in the center of the room.  As he approached, what he had taken for an empty space there resolved itself as a circle of straw and, in the center of the circle, a steel cage, about six feet square, with a lone figure lying curled up inside, half-covered by the straw. \n\nDawson approached slowly, his M-4 trained on the curled-up form, as Gottfried approached silently from the other side. Dawson  snapped on his tactical light, throwing the figure into bright illumination and clearer resolution as his NVD adapted to the new lighting. What Dawson saw was a young girl, no older than ten, maybe even just eight or nine, sitting up and staring into the light, pieces of straw still clinging to her straggling hair.  She blinked sleepily and held one hand up to shield her eyes, but said nothing, and made no attempt to move.\n\n“What the fuck?” Dawson said softly.  He looked up and caught Gottfried’s eyes and the sniper’s small shrug, noting that Gottfried was keeping his weapon trained on the girl.\n\n“Repeat, didn’t copy,” came Elario’s voice over the comms.\n\n“Uh, stand by,” Dawson whispered into his mic.  He looked around the room again, but what you saw was what you got: Swept clean, no furniture of any kind, no light switch or electrical hookup, no heat source. Also, there was no food and water, outside or inside the cage. Despite himself, Dawson grew angry.\n\n“The fuck *is* this?” he asked Gottfried, muting his mic. “Intel screw-up?”\n\n“Can’t be,” Gottfried said. “That colonel says they’ve been watching this place for months, that they’d tracked the hajis here. Said this was where they were keeping this ‘secret weapon’ of theirs.”\n\n“Well it ain’t a fuckin little girl,” Dawson grumbled, switching off his light. He keyed his mic: “Gottfried and Elario, check out the second structure; Burke, keep an eye on this one.” He waved Gottfried out, then walked out the door, glancing back at the girl. She hadn’t moved, and was now watching him intently. Even though it was pitch dark, he got the sense she was staring him directly in the eye, and paused to stare at her for a moment before heading outside again.\n\nHe watched as Gottfried and Elario split up to check out the other building, glanced at Burke atop the wall, then keyed his radio, changing to the base frequency.\n\n “Brightboy,  Brightboy, this is Anchor Two Six.”\n\n“Anchor Two Six, go ahead,” came the immediate response.\n\n“Brightboy, please confirm target package. On site and, uh, it appears target coordinates not, repeat NOT accurate.”\n\nThere was a pause, and then  the colonel’s voice came again, this time with a hint of anger: \n\n“Anchor Two Six, coordinates *are* confirmed, proceed on mission.”\n\nDawson looked up as Elario came into view behind the first building and gave him a thumbs-down – the second building was unoccupied.\n\n“Brightboy, lone occupant on site is a minor girl, repeat, a *minor girl*, eight to ten years. Do you copy?” Dawson said, allowing a hint of frustration into his voice.\n\n“Anchor Two Six, this is Brightboy.  Confirm your last, and repeat: *Proceed on mission*. Advise on exfil. Brightboy out.”\n\nDawson drew a deep breath and switched back to team frequency, momentarily tempted to call the mission off. But his years of training and the ire in the colonel’s voice argued against it. He looked around at his team, glancing at Burke, then keyed his mic. “Okay, Gottfried, watch the main gate. Elario, cover the door. Burke, call for the chopper.  I’ll be back in a minute.”\n\nDawson strode back to the door, securing his carbine to his chest rig and drawing his suppressed .45.  He’d make this quick, then get his team out before this night got any more fucked up.\n\nAs he reentered the room, he saw in his NVD that the girl was now sitting up, hands in her lap, watching the door. Again, despite the blackness of the room, he had the sense that she was looking straight into his eyes, and that she somehow knew exactly what he was there for.\n\nHe approached the cage, stopping a foot or so away, his drawn pistol at his side. “Sorry about this, kid,” he said softly, staring into her face. She was a pretty little thing, even despite the dirty hair and ragged, torn dress. “It’s not personal.”\n\nHe raised the pistol and centered his sights on her forehead, directly between her eyes. And paused. \n\n It was the eyes that made her so pretty, Dawson thought:  Huge, luminous and dark. Almost black, in fact, although it was hard to tell through the NVD. I should look at her directly, he mused, his thoughts seeming to drift a bit. It’s only right, if you’re about to kill a little kid, to look them in the eye first.\n\nDawson drew the goggles up over his head and dropped them to the ground.  The pistol fell from his other hand, and he sank to his knees in front of the cage. In the dimness, he saw the girl reach through the bars and take hold of his now-empty hand.  In doing so, her thin little arm brushed against one of the bars, causing a brief hiss, like water hitting a hot stove burner, and the smell of burning, seared flesh mixed with something like sulfur.\n\nOf course it burned her, Dawson thought dreamily, watching as she lowered her head and fastened her mouth on his wrist. It’s made of silver, not steel.  And they’ve been starving her. That’s why she can’t just push it over. But I sure can. Oh, but this feels too good … don’t stop, don’t stop sweetie, he thought at her, his eyes growing dimmer as the greedy sounds of sucking and swallowing continued in the dark room.\n\nThrough his ear bud, now unnoticed, came a quiet voice. “Boss? You okay in there? Chopper’s on its way, ETA twelve mikes. Boss? Boss?”

                                             Unlikely. Card industry regulations require merchants to disclose breaches or face auditory hell. That's why Target did this, not because they are grown ups. Wanna bet the disclosure is vague because they use a shitty legacy payment processing stack which violates PCI in at least 3 ways and the breach wasn't epic terminal exploits but something stupid like shared ssh keys or unencrypted database backups which the forensic audit will find anyway?

of nearly three weeks.\n\nJeez Target, that is a really long time. That's like 3 years in reddit time. \n\n&gt;Investigators believed the data was obtained via software installed on point-of-sales terminals used to swipe magnetic strips on payment cards.\n\nWhat?? How do you let that happen? \n\n&gt;The company said it hired a forensics firm to investigate the incident. \n\nYou have a forensics lab! http://www.abullseyeview.com/2012/02/an-unexpected-career-target-forensic-services-laboratory/

               Yep, close the card and get a new one.

Also, Visa and MC will probably send alerts with compromised card numbers to affected financial institutions in the coming days, and new cards will get issued anyway.

                                                           I've taken the liberty of drafting a script, you can modify it or use as is.\n\nDear Senator _________,\n\nI'm very disappointed by the provisions of Senate Bill 199 , and I hope I can help inform you in a decision regarding the legislation by showing you the facts of airsoft, and why, though it might seem strange to some, is a perfectly safe activity which has a positive effect on California, which makes no sense to impose harsh restrictions on.\n\nAirsoft guns are not only limited by law to persons over 18 for purchase, and require an orange tip for sale/transport, but displaying them in public with or without the tip is a breach in the law. To impose stricter requirements would not only be making criminals of honest people, but damaging to the state of California.\n\nThe wonderful activity of airsoft is centered in the great state California, an overwhelming majority of airsoft related businesses in the US reside in CA, as do many major fields. Many arenas used chiefly for airsoft are also used to train Law Enforcement personnel, restriction of current airsoft guns would result in a significant loss of revenue, and result in facilites  charging law enforcement higher fees for their use, a less efficient use of tax dollars.  To ban the use of airsoft guns in their present state would decimate the industry as a whole, and would not only decrease tax revenue, but drive jobs from away from California. \n\nDespite a recent isolated tragedy that happened as a result of both negligence and ignorance of both current laws and a child's activity, airsoft is incredibly safe. All players are required by fields to wear ANZI rated ballistic eye protection, which is rated far above the small impact of an airsoft BB. Statistically, airsoft is one of the safest sports played competitively, even more so than golf. To ban airsoft guns because they pose a perceived threat to public safety makes no more sense than banning golf clubs.\n\nNot only is banning airsoft guns going to make no difference in public safety, it is an arbitrary target of a specific replica. The bill makes no provisions regarding paintball markers, even though they can look just as realistic as real firearms, if not more, as they do not require an orange tip. Non functioning replicas can just as easily be mistaken as true firearms, but airsoft devices are unfairly singled out under SB 199.\n\nAirsoft is a cherished hobby to people all over this wonderful state. Ordinary people all over the state participate, and former and active military are also involved in the sport. Games are regularly hosted for charity, the Wounded Warrior Foundation being the chief benefactor of many games.\n\nTo ban airsoft replicas in it's present state would deprive many people of their beloved hobby, their livelihood, have little to no impact on public safety, and result in an economic disadvantage for California. This legislation does nothing except detract from one of the many things that makes this state great.\n\nI hope you will reconsider,\n\n(Your Name Here)



                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You make the assumption that Target was non-compliant with security procedures. If they were, then they will almost certainly be fined and/or sued by the card processing companies (Visa, MC, etc) or by groups representing the customers affected.\n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that they were fully compliant with all PCI standards and this breach was the result of something else. If that is the case, then Target was not negligible and is not liable. You can't hold someone to standards that do not exist.\n\nFurthermore, it is possible that Target was not fully compliant with security standards but didn't know about it. Companies often bring in outside experts to consult on or implement security standards for them. These outside companies (or even a third company) then audit the security standards and sign a legal document saying that the company is compliant with security standards. It is unlikely, though possible, that one of these assessing companies (called [Qualified Security Assessors](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/become_qsa.php)) missed a security hole and told Target that they were compliant, even though they were not. In such a case, Target should not be the one to pay for the damages. The QSA would be at fault.
“Have you anything to declare?” piped the gigantic Bioroid that was standing in Reille’s way. Kit was familiar with Haas-Bioroid’s tech, and she had always loved the chance to stop her busy routine of hacking through what many would consider the most impenetrable of servers to just reflect on life. “A kindred spirit!”, Mrs. Peddler had thought. \n\n“I don’t know. What is it that you are looking for?”, Kit asked, the innocence in her voice coming through.\n\nThe first generation Bioroid turned to directly face Kit. “No Interfaces. No Viruses. Limited access.”\n\nThat was not going to be a problem for Kit.\n\n“Mmm… can’t say I have any of those.”, Kit answered.\n\nThe Bioroid slowly returned to its natural stance and pulsated a deep-red color for a few seconds. A system rig scan, Kit suspected. Its visualization quickly returned to its natural light-blue hue on completion.\n\n“Scan complete. Your access is now limited, and you may pass.”, said the Bioroid.\n\nWell, that was easy. That said, Kit felt a little disappointed. Unlike the other Bioroid’s, this one did not show a lot of creativity. Kit remembered having her wits being challenged when she interacted with a Sherlock 1.0 Bioroid who thought he’d ran into Dr. Moriarty himself. Likewise, she remembers a Heimdall 1.0 that had spoken most prophetically to her, as if the Norse mythos had awakened from the annals of history back into full force. But this… This was nothing impressive.\n\n“Can I at least know your name?”, Kit called out as she was about to step through the serial exit access port.\n\n“My designation is Hudson. First-generation. It was a pleasure to meet you.”\n\nAt least he’s polite…\n\n---\n\n“Hudson 1.0’s programming is TOO specific!”, cried out Akitaro Watanabe. He was currently sitting within Chairman Hiro’s office, and he and his boss were going over the specifics of the ICE imports that Jinteki had made over the past month. Most of their foreign-ICE came straight from Haas-Bioroid, which included the ever popular first-generation (and, lest Akitaro forgets, ‘affordable’) Eli and Viktor programs. However, there was also some desire from other higher-ups to try out the new Hudson package. After hearing about the desecration of the Replicating Perfection labs from a combined Medium viral demolition strike, the desire to keep the hacker accesses limited was seen by some to be a welcome change.\n\n“I do not see it this way, Akitaro.” Chairman Hiro stated, his speech strained from his advanced age. “While Haas-Bioroid is a competitor, they share our philosophy of ensuring honor amongst our welcome guests. We allow them access, but the penalties for getting through or even for what they might find are high.” Chairman Hiro paused for a moment as he considered his next words carefully. “However, we must recognize that even that may not be enough anymore. So for when even that threat alone is insufficient, we feel that Hudson 1.0 would keep our enemies success at a limit.”\n\n“And we should assume that our enemies even want to succeed greatly in the first place! For those without the fancy interfaces and virus programs, it does absolutely nothing! These purchases are a mistake and a waste of time!” Akitaro curtly responded.\n\n“I do not accept your tone of voice Akitaro. Do not forget that our other countermeasures would make illegal access prohibitive as well!” Chairman Hiro growled back.\n\nAkitaro grimaced at that and paused to calm himself down. Suddenly, realizing exactly who he was talking to, the shock caused him to quickly bow his head down. “My apologizes, Hiro-san. My concern is always for our own protection from the foreign intruders.” \n\n“As it should be!” Chairman Hiro said, his stoicism wavering. Chairman Hiro then sat back down in his spartan office chair, took off his glasses, and consciously rubbed the nape of his neck. “Akitaro, we at Jinteki appreciate your work. You have always made doing more with less a reality. I expect you to continue your duty with honor and in good graces.” Hiro pulled his chair in, this time directly facing Akitaro. “My friend, your feedback is of crucial importance to me. Tell me, as clearly as you can, why Hudson will not work for us.”\n\n“Hiro-san. I will admit that Hudson will stop our enemies from succeeding too greatly. But it itself does not stop our enemies from succeeding in the first place! Likewise, it only limits accesses to data, but does nothing with respect to financial link breaches or non-access related attacks. The horrific account siphoning of Santiago from last year, if you recall, would still have happened under Hudson’s watch! Likewise, I now hear word of a dangerous program that would expose our entire happenings right here in our headquarters to the outside world! Our other countermeasures could stop them, but you know as well as I do how much financing it takes to support multiple ICE on our servers. There is only so much I can do in that respect.”\n\n“But what if it were just a preventative measure?” Hiro asked, “A protection against a most dangerous possibility!”.\n\n“It would cost too much! I don’t know what benefits our marketing campaign has with that Miranda girl, but it cannot be enough to protect everything! Time and time again I have made the requests to prepare our countermeasures to the accounting department, and time and time again I am always told we have insufficient funds… Hedging any part of our countermeasures against a certain type of attack does not bode well against those who do not have said attacks” Akitaro countered calmly. “The balance of keeping our projects moving forwards and protecting those projects is a most precious one that both you and I have seen disrupted one time too many. It is truly a battle to maintain this balance!”\n\n“Mmm…”, Chairman Hiro mused. “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.” Though those words have originally come from a Chinaman, the impact of Sun Tzu’s words on Japan’s incredible history could not be ignored. However, as Hiro had just decided, this “Hudson” foreigner would not have much more of an impact on anything here.\nThe Chairman stood up and made his way around his desk towards Akitaro. He placed his hand on Watanabe’s shoulder, in an almost fatherly fashion, “I shall pair you with Midori. You will use your collective judgment to determine whether Hudson is effective or not, and what to replace it with. Keep me apprised of your situation. But if what you say is true, then we may have just made a critical mistake in our ICE imports for the quarter...”\n\n---\n\nBernice Mai’s eyes flickered left and right across the multitude of vid-screens that composed the majority of her current view. She was looking for any breaches of any sort. Launch a full-blown geological position attack based on any incoming IPs and isolate it to an address. Those were her instructions from the higher-ups at NBN. \n\nSuddenly, the screens, one by one, turned a reddish-hue. An access attempt! Bernice steeled herself for the challenge ahead. Failure to latch onto the target would not be accepted by her superiors.\n\n“What the…” chimed Whizzard, who suddenly appeared on all the screens facing Bernice. The sudden shock was quickly replaced with a sly grin as he realized that his quarry was loaded with access data!\n\nBernice Mai shuddered at the sight of the portly hacker; Whizzard was well known for his ability to annihilate just about anything belonging to a Corporation. Her counter-hack might be able to pinpoint his location, but...\n\n“Ohhhh, what a lovely everything you have here. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it. SSSSSSssssss!”\n\nBernice Mai had been able to trace the target easily. It was almost like he wanted to be found. Knowing what was coming next, she flung herself to the floor, as far away from the console as possible.\n\nThe sparks that nearly blinded the room with a bright white light confirmed her suspicions. Her terminal was now completely busted.\n\nThe room quickly turned from its natural yellowish hue into a more sinister reddish hue. Whizzard was trying to access everything! Why had the technicians not rezzed the Red Herrings protocol yet? The data on the Astroscript Pilot Program was in danger!\n\n“Look at all this stuff! What should I access next?”\n\nSuddenly, the room’s lighting shut off. The room was almost pitch black, save for one of the monitors from Bernice’s console. It was still showing the Anarch, who was currently preoccupied with punching away at his keyboard.\n\n“LIMITED ACCESS ONLY!” boomed a mechanical voice.\n\nWhizzard had turned around to face something that was just off screen. “You again! Computer, fire up the Yog.0, and empty the Datasucker buffer into that thing.”\n\n“LIMITED ACCESS ONLY!” boomed the mechanical voice again.\n\n“Datasucker buffer is currently at 0% capacity. Unable to comply.”\n\n“DAMNIT!”\n\nAnd that was when the monitor went blank. \n\nBernice Mai stood up, and felt her way through the almost pitch-black room to the entrance. She placed her palm on the hand scanner, apparently something that was still working despite the sorry state the server room was now in. As the light streamed in from the hallway, Mrs. Mai saw the still deactivated assets that she was assigned to protect. The sound of technicians scurrying towards her location, no doubt after-response teams to provide clean-up, confirmed that her work here was done.\n\n“Huh… Can’t believe that all worked.” Mrs. Mai mused, before stepping out. \n

been playing since the first Splinter Cell came out and I bought it when I was 16 or something, I fucking love stealth games and I've played em all, from Thief 2 to Monaco.\n\n So when I first popped it in I reluctantly did the first tutorial mission, and immediately jumped into SpiesvMercs instantly.  God damn was it a blast.  Multiplayer is where Blacklist seriously shines mostly due to how surprisingly fair it is and how well balanced it is for teamwork and communication.  If you haven't checked out how well Spies v Mercs turned out do yourself a favor and watch some videos.  This late in the game there are still new tricks and surprises being pulled by clever players.\n\n\nSingle player, yes the pacifist option has returned.  I've ghosted several levels, non-lethaled the rest on my first playthrough, but the single player missions don't really cater well to that playstyle.  Too often Sam gets an overdose of testosterone and has to kill everyone in the room.  Too often I think to myself why didn't they send in Rainbow 6 to do this job if Sam isn't making this a Stealth mission anymore.  Older Splinter Cell games used to be about "environments", small contained playgrounds where a player had to reach a destination, hack a terminal, interrogate a single witness, that sort of thing.  \n\n\nTonally the story has become about characters and less about the semi-realistic or at least believable plots of cyber warfare and is now about actual warfare.  Sam is no longer a dark-humored navy seal and now just an aggressive thug that tortures and mutilates terrorists on sight,   Instead of jokes about Sam whispering into a guard's ear about where the bathroom is, a bad TV actor says bad cliche movie lines.  One line in particular where a team member asks Sam about how he plans to stop the next attack he says "We're not going to stop this attack"  then after several pregnant pauses he finishes his dramatic line "we're going to stop all of them."  It's just plain awful. There's one scene in particular that stands out where Briggs, Sam's Protege and Successor, helps Sam get to a Prisoner in Guantanamo by using his credentials to escort Sam as a fake prisoner to interrogate/torture a terrorist, but nobody thinks for Briggs to just do the interrogation himself as his CIA credentials clearly let him get where they need to go.  \n\n\n\nEverything in that story is UGLY, brutal and just plain sadistic.  Sam's Job used to require not being seen because it would start an international incident, however in Blacklist he'll hunt down a terrorist with order to kill on sight when a well-equipped team should be doing that job. one scene in particular starts with Sam stabbing a guy and ends with his target claiming he's a deep cover MI-6 operative and Sam jumped the gun.  Frequently I hoped a terrorist would give sam false information under duress that he would act on  and thus have bad intel and it results in a catastrophe, but that never happened.  The Story has thrown away the Tom Clancyness of the old games to put further emphasis on a small cast of characters butting heads while Sam mows down hundreds of enemy combatants with drone strikes and Grim even fires with a drone on Iranian soldiers who aren't involved with the blacklist just to prevent Sam from getting caught.\n\nReturning to gameplay, there are definitely good opportunities for stealth in several missions, but when you're firing from a drone at marked targets you're no longer playing a stealth game, it's like a really half-assed minigame.\n\nThe essentials are there in Blacklist's single player, it's just that the level design and Story didn't take advantage of how good the stealth elements came together.

She backs it up that claim the first section of the article:\n\n&gt; A woman doesn’t even need to occupy a professional writing perch at a prominent platform to become a target. According to a 2005 report by the Pew Research Center, which has been tracking the online lives of Americans for more than a decade, women and men have been logging on in equal numbers since 2000, but the vilest communications are still disproportionately lobbed at women. We are more likely to report being stalked and harassed on the Internet—of the 3,787 people who reported harassing incidents from 2000 to 2012 to the volunteer organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, 72.5 percent were female. Sometimes, the abuse can get physical: A Pew survey reported that five percent of women who used the Internet said “something happened online” that led them into “physical danger.” And it starts young: Teenage girls are significantly more likely to be cyberbullied than boys. Just appearing as a woman online, it seems, can be enough to inspire abuse. In 2006, researchers from the University of Maryland set up a bunch of fake online accounts and then dispatched them into chat rooms. Accounts with feminine usernames incurred an average of 100 sexually explicit or threatening messages a day. Masculine names received 3.7.

When you are breaching a door or other kind of barrier that you want to get through to assault the area behind it you want to be as close as you can to the breach point so when the charge goes off you can rush into the breach and take out the bad guys as fast as you can and catch them off guard. So the idea is to make the explosive breaching charge no bigger than the amount needed to breach the target so you can be as close as possible to the charge. You would use a series of math calculations to figure out how far you have to be away from the charge (stand off) to be safe. An increase in 3 PSI is enough to puncture eardrums and damage lungs.

transaction message with the card number and CVV/CVC at least part of the way.  \n\nAs an card issuing institution, if you're not receiving the pin block in the transaction messages, it's because someone else (network/switch) is performing pin verification on your behalf before you get the message.  I could be wrong but I believe that as of 2002 or 2003, all pin functions must be performed in dedicated hardware (which is expensive) so that the keys can be kept physically secure, separate from a production environment where access is easier/common (admins/etc). Since it's expensive to buy/maintain/secure/audit a HSM, some institutions have the network/switch verify the pin for them.   If this is the case, your system is only has to check or update a balance to return an approval code so there's no need to send the pin block.  \n\nUnless it's been amended and I can't find it, ISO 8583 messages (the basis of the message formats Target will likely use to connect to other card networks/institutions) use a small 64 bit encrypted pin block and it's possible (likely?) that they may use the same 64 bit pin blocks internally.  In other words, depending on where the breach occurred, the attackers may have loads of 64 bit encrypted pin blocks to play with.\n\nThis is the part where I get fuzzy and expect a reddit flogging;  Even though AES uses 128bit keys, if we know something about the small block of encrypted data, such as the first 32 bits are likely consistent, I believe it becomes significantly easier to brute force the key out of the pin block. \n\nFrom what I remember, a 4 digit PIN was typically represented in packed hex format in a 4 byte/64bit field left padded with 0s or Fs (1234 would be 00 00 12 34) and then encrypted.  If I'm right about it being significantly easier to crack a 64bit block if something is know about it, hopefully by now they use random data to pad the field and rely on the verifying party to only check the relevant portion of the unencrypted pin.  \n\nI don't know if it matters or would make it easier, but depending where the breach was; the attackers may even have an encrypted copy of the working key specific pin blocks were encrypted with (the key for the pin block is periodically changed and transmitted between points under a key exchange key).  \n\nFWIW I never got too deep into the encryption itself.  I primarily worked on interfaces (between our system and other institutions) so I only needed to know how to pass the keys/pin blocks to the HSM (Atalla) for translation to a different key or how to request a new working key.\n\nTLDR; Encrypted PINs are passed with the card data through most of the process and they MAY be really easy to crack.

compromised,\n\nYour bank knew the day of or after which of their customers were affected by the Target breach.\n\nI work for a very large bank and within 2 days we had a list of every single one of our cards that was compromised due to the breach. While the cards were not all immediately closed, to prevent an outcry of inconvenience by customer, there were new immediate transaction limits placed on those cards until their replacements arrived in the mail.\n\nNot sure why your bank reacted so slow.

                      For those who can't be bothered to read the actual paper which seems to include ground-zero who submitted it....\n\nHeadline is misleading -  the mobile phone implementation only worked on two laptops, one of which I doubt anyone is likely to really use anymore given it is a Pentium 3 laptop from 2001. THe mobile phone implementation will fail on most laptops because of the frequencies involved. It didn't listen to the sound of the CPU at all, rather the system. It is also questionable as to whether it is truly a hack.\n\nThe attack only works by having the target machine decrypt cyphertexts chosen by the attacker. In short, they only know it works because they already know the answer. Without being able to have the computer decrypt a known text first, they cannot decode anything at all. Is this truly a hack?\n\nThey used microphone elements with frequency ranges far higher than mobile phones, used a pre-amp and an ultra low noise amplifier, the results which were then digitized using an external DAC in order to get it to work universally.\n\nThe mobile phone implementation only worked on certain laptops, basically an ancient Thinkpad T23 and a X300, as the other test subjects didn't produce usable sound within the bandwidth of the mobile phone microphones.

these guys are hilarious.\n\n&gt; I would argue that society (and I don't mean government) itself executes justice. Now for efficiency, society can deem immediate personal execution of justice to be appropriate.\n\nIf we're saying society executes justice, that presupposes that there's a codified doctrine or pre-established agreement on what the terms of that justice is, and what conditions must be met for the deliverance of that justice - that would be mandated if you were actually to try and install this way of thinking. This dipshit is saying that "society allows the individual to execute justice as he sees fit," a doctrine that wouldn't last more than 3 days in Ron Paul's magical libertarian America without swiftly being changed after individuals decide "justice" is the right to shoot someone for looking at their girlfriend wrong *BUT HE VIOLATED MUH MUH FREEDOM BY MAKING MY SELF CONSCIOUS CUZ MY GF WAS LOOKING BACK AT HIM AND SHES MUH PROPERTY LIKE MUH GUNS R*. The following result, the codified doctrine I referred to, has a word in the English language that already describes that kind of thing: "government." \n\nHow is it possible to have individualism if you require society to determine what the degree of punishment is for offenders of the NAP? Who determines what is a breach of the NAP, by the way? Is it up to the discretion of the individuals whose property has been violated? So what if, hypothetically, a crackhead breaks into my house and shoots my daughter and escapes because my aim was off - I'm allowed to kill his daughter now, right? Or what if I believe that looking at my house is a violation of the NAP because I can feel them judging me? If I find that to be a breach of the NAP, then I'm allowed to execute the justice I see fit right? Because according to this fucking moron, society says that my personal will should be the law of the land when I'm violated? \n\nWant a fun image? Just imagine the implications of this type of radical vigilantism in tandem with the legal precedent that states corporations are people. Wal*Mart can send shock troops to scare you into shopping there, because you're violating the NAP by shopping at Target, and they get to choose what punishment is fit because "society says so."\n\nFucking top lel, libertarians are retarded.

stolen after shopping together at Target within the breach time window, and the charges were made at the same time at a Wal-Mart in Florida.\n\nFinally got my new card, and what do I do last night... shop at Target (before the data breach is reported). Hopefully they have their shit straight now.

                          o When you jump out of a plane at high altitudes, your parachute is strapped to your back, and your gear is strapped to your legs/chest. \n\no Special forces do not pull parachutes according to other people, they pull it according to height. \n\no You do not activate night vision goggles while descending because they destroy depth perception. It would have made the landing harder/more uncomfortable. \n\no Unlipping a parachute and running off is a surefire way to get caught. Those things are beacons in the wind. \n\no One squad is not able to form a perimiter, lock down exits AND raid a building. It's too small, and physically impossible - also it's probably not protocol for a raid to lock down exits. \n\no Everyone's job is to look out for snipers and the priority target. You don't assign one person to do a job everyone should be doing. It's like your job as a driver of a car isn't to look out for oncoming potentially dangerous traffic sometimes, it always is. \n\no Tossing rocks is in NO way a go to military tactic. Shooting him&gt;stabbing him&gt;choking him\n\no Guarding stairs is a nightmare. He probably would have just signalled a breach, and the last 2 guys would know exactly what to do. It's one of those things you learn from training about stacking up. \n\no Legos don't crunch under your boot. Your boot crunches on legos. \n\no For a group that are "The best" he doesn't seem to get that, breaking ranks before a room is declared "Clear" to go comfort a girl (who is not meant to be approached the way she did) is a bad idea and against everything in the book.\n\no You never swear on the radio. NEVER. \n\no I would never drop my gun if someone else pulled out a detonator. I'm pretty sure cops don't put away their guns if someone pulls out a detonator. Putting away your firearm is an immediate disadvantage, physically, and psychologically.

was it light enough for me but it looked good, too! Extra bonus - I went to Target to buy some, and the last box in the Light shade had a $5 off coupon attached, so I got it for half off!\n\n\n**Rant**: NYX had technical difficulties during the Fall sale, and while my payment went through my order got someone else's order number and I never got anything. What I wanted sold out, and I also missed out on the 40% off Cyber Monday sale because I was waiting to see if the first order would arrive. Payment was refunded and I was told I'd be sent a credit for the inconvenience but I haven't received further contact. I've been buying their makeup for years, but this experience is putting me off.

The cyberpunk, dystopia, paranoia, humanity on the cusp of maybe something good but probably something terrible, elves and magic, guns and cyberspace, and Indians but we all seem to forget about them, crazy-ass hodgepodge that is Shadowrun.\n\n**Morality**\n\nUnlike DnD there is no big bad, no clear right and wrong.  The game is mostly about small criminals working for big criminals.  You can paint those small criminals as noble, ala Ocean's Eleven, or you can paint them as totally ruthless ala Heat, or just as plain old henchmen workin for the bad guy, ala the Ringwraiths to someone's Sauron (or more likely, the orcs that the Ringwraiths hired to do something.  Hey, it is not like you get to meet Sauron every day.)  The point is, the game can be taken in a lot of directions.  Your team might be Robin Hood and the corporations King John, but then your team might be thugs working for Littlefinger or Tywin Lannister instead.  Unless you are dead set on playing someone at one end of the good or evil spectrum you might want to play it by ear and get a sense for what kind of world the GM envisions and what the other players are game for.\n\n**Character creation**\n\nJust as a friendly suggestion, you might end up a bit disappointed if you stick with the character a while and find you can't do all the things you want to do so well.  If your character is a bounty hunter, you should think about what kind of a bounty hunter you are and focus on getting a few of those core skills down, rather than trying to think of every situation you might encounter and how to react to it.\n\n**Physical-based bounty**\n\nIf you think about a bounty hunter as a burly, unstoppable guy with a name like Big Dan the Troll Catcher, well...Big Dan is a guy who is half-bloodhound, half-pitbull, hunting out his quarry in the streets.  Your favorite method of questioning is with mean Mr. Right Fist and you apply it liberally at your quarries' favorite local hangout.  You find your target's hideout and then lay in wait for your chance to tackle him to the ground, maybe after a good footchase.  \n\nYou are gonna focus on stuff like strength, body and agility, and leave the willpower and charisma to those other guys.  You tote a big gun like a shotgun or maybe an uzi to scare people but most of the time his well-honed judo skills come into play to incapacitate efficiently and with no collateral damage to anyone walking by.  After all, Big Dan is a bit of an outlaw, but he doesn't want to go to prison for manslaughter.  You do have big intimidation skills, but you are not going to get much more subtle that Fist to Face, then Repeat Question, and so you doesn't have those more delicate negotiating skills.  Maybe Big Dan has so much street ettiquitte that the Lone Star comes to him from time to time to hunt people down.  \n\nThen one day, Big Dan one day gets a taste of some big money from a corporate client on a quasi-legal takedown pulling a guy out of another corporate enclave.  It was all too easy, and the payoff incredible, and that gets Big Dan to wondering why he has been chasing down bums and criminals where there is some real money to be made working for the corps...\n\nOn the other hand...\n\n**Information-based bounty hunter**\n\nMaybe your card says '''bounty hunter''' on it, but you spend most of your days in the office.  You keep a gun, pump some irons, and occassionaly run backup to help out your boss, Big Dan the Troll Catcher, who is this huge beefcake guy...but your real skills are with information.  You are an expert at tracking people through the Matrix, sniffing through their receipts and half-glimpses in security cameras and blimps in the public network, to figure out where they are, and what they like to do.  You have some breaking and entering skills to get into a guy's apartment and sift through his personal stuff, but you try to avoid the direct confrontation.  Maybe you can fast talk a landlady or a doorman but you would rather just steal or forge the right keys and dress in advance, and get through the door with no notice and no questions.  If some gunplay is needed you are very tactical about it - you keep your distance, and take a shot when the guy is least expecting it.  You leave the up-in-your-face, rough and tough stuff to your boss.  \n\nLately though, you get to wondering if your latent Matrix skills and general sneakiness couldn't earn you more money than being an office worker for Big Dan...\n\n**Social-based bounty hunter**\n\nYou are international.  You ride jets, smoke cloves, eat cavier, and you hunt men down with a chrome pen and a cell phone and a flashy smile.  Oh, they give your job a fancier name, "extraction," but really you are the apex hunter of the urban jungle.  Though you are an artist with an Ares Predator, your days of sweat and toil and the chase are all but over.  What you do instead, is draw the net to catch your prey, and tell your hired men when to spring the trap.  \n\nYou are given a target, who will be in a heavily secured facility or be protected around the clock by a tedious number of body guards.  You make the right calls, you hire the right people for the job and dole out only the information they need to get it done.  You have a dozen platinum business cards and golden personalities and they are your social lockpicks to open the door into the gilded world of top-flight corporate and government.  With the buildings scoped, the groundwork laid, the goons put into place, you wait for the right moment for the capture.  A carefully arranged emergency, or a trap laid with irrisitable women, or that split second when a man steps out of a building but has yet to reach his car...that is when you order the strike.  Afterwards, you congratulate yourself with champange.\n\nYou plot to kidnap famous heiresses from their homes and to drain the brains of a research department one man at at time.  You are a smiling enigma, a globe-trotting phantom who exists only for a moment, and the only trace of your passage is a few borrowed hands and a false name in the hotel you stayed for a week. You can gain just enough trust from anyone to get the job done, and then you dissappear in a trail of exhaust fumes as your hired driver whisks you to another appointment, in another city in another county...\n\n...that is, until someone catches up with you.  Former employer, former target, former lover, someone has finally put together enough to burn you badly.  Your money is frozen, your possessions destroyed, a nasty virus has ruined most of your expensive cyberware, and you leave your burning hotel run just a few steps ahead of some hired gunmen.  Now you have to start again...just get enough money together for one last job, yes, to find out who did this to you, and make them pay...\n\n**What I meant by all this**\n\nMan this ended up being a lot longer than I expected!  Anyway, the point is, each of these bounty hunters are people who are hired to find other people, but the way they go about it is totally different.  Nobody can really be all three of these guys, at least not at the start of the game, and even if they could I would argue it is more fun to be a realy good Big Dan than it is to be Jimmy Godskillz, who can seduce a woman, run a marathon and hack a doorlock at the same time (though I guess I would like to see someone try).  It is easy to say, start with a character and be commmited to that character, but it is easy to imagine a situation where your character needs just a little bit of Pistols, or a little bit of lockpicking, or a little bit of negotiation.  Don't sweat the little skills.  Think in broad strokes, what does my character do well.  Focus on a few big things that you know you want to perform time and time again, and think of creative ways to bring those skills into the situation, instead of trying to plan ahead for everything your character might come across.

                                  Cyber bullying is when the majority of students not only pick on the unpopular kid at school, but then go on their facebook and call them a worthless loser who should die, or a fat slut who won't be anything other than a prostitute, or any other number of things that are clearly meant to cause emotional distress to the target.  This is especially bad the more elaborate the attempt it, such as tracking down social media accounts that the victim has tried to hide or even fake an online friendship to get close to the victim to cause more harm.\n\nNow, in general, these things are already illegal.  It is more of a case of current laws needing to be enforced.

                             BF4 hacker here (scumbag reporting for duty)\n\nthe particular hack I use has a ton of options. right now I use ESP boxes, so I see a green box around ALL enemies ALL the time, and a red box around them when I have line of sight. it also draws a line in white on my screen that points to them.\n\nThe aimbot portion is also customizable. It isn't always on, but rather activates on a button press which can be set. most common is right mouse so it only turns on when ADS. other's set it for alt key or whatever for hipfire aimbot, but that' silly.\n\naimbot also has different mods of targeting. you choose the method, either distance of FOV (how close they are to center screen), or a combo of both. then you choose the bone, or the area it aims for (heat, chest, abdomen, limbs), and then set your FOV. FOV determines how close they must be to center screen to target them. I use 3-9 range so it doesn't "snap" around a lot. I've flown under the radar undetected so far. always some hackusations, but keeping a realistic kdr/accuracy is easy and vital.\n\nthere are also some other options in the hack, including auto-spotting, always-on mini map (enemy always on minimap) and some tweaks here and there, but the ESP and aimbot are the important ones.\n\nscumbag out :P\n\nedit -  for those wondering about punk buster and fairfight, they are easy to beat. the mod detects when pb is taking a screenshot and turns off all features. it is also hidden in memory so it is undetectable. been using it since the week after bf4 dropped, still not banned and I use it every time I play. fairfight is laughable. it only tracks stats, and since i play smart with the hack it doesn't flag me. keep realistic kdr (some matches dominate, other go average, keep the overall around a 2.5-3, not higher than 5). keep accuracy normal. fire a clip or two into a wall and then play with aimbot normal. don't get long range kills with close range weapons. no 100m 1911 headshots or such crap.\n\n**edit2**\nWow this is blowing up more than I expected. I'd like to answer some repeated questions here:\n\nWhy do I hack? - I like winning. I am not a terrible player without the hack (kdr 1.23, spm ~275), but I hate getting killed repeatedly and the feeling of doing poorly. I wish there was a deeper philosophical reason, but that's it.\n\nFuckneckbeard virgin - I probably don't fit your imagined visage of a bf4 hacker. I'm a mid thirties white male with a wife, mortgage, and student loans. I hold a boring office job and videogames are my hobby.\n\nHow is that possibly fun? - It's not. At least not at this point. Once I got to 110 it really became boring playing the game with the hack. It's too easy and I don't like it all that much now. Recently I've been playing without it (for about 2 weeks now), and it's much more enjoyable. I'm sure once the cap is raised I'll use it again, and I will bust it out on anyone who is obviously hacking (counter hacking if you will).\n\nWe're gonna track your IP! - these threats I've gotten in my inbox (3 of them now) are funny. I pay for a VPN membership that has 18 servers in various US cities and countries. I registered in Texas, posted once from Florida, once from Seattle, and now from the Netherlands. Obviously I'm in none of these locations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       There is a great deal of topics dealing with this, so I thought I would confirm what we will definately be doing, and give some background why they are not in yet. List not exhaustive and will be added too as time allows.\n \n**More Zombies**\n \nTarget delivery: Ongoing\n \nWe absolutely plan to have more zombies. To cope with the current total dynamic entity count of over 10000 we have had to make a great deal of optimizations. If loot is completely removed, we can easily run 4000 zombies in our debug builds. In the new year we will be optimizing the way we handle dynamic objects (such as loot) a great deal more which should give us significant savings - but the change was considered too risky to be done prior to alpha launch. If we had problems, we would have delayed the project further by months.\n \n**Multithreaded Server**\n \nTarget delivery: Early 2014 &amp; Ongoing\n \nTo assist with increasing player and zombie numbers, we will be parallelizing the server architecture. Currently RV does offload some extra threads off to other cores, but this is for rendering and file handling - neither of which are issues for the dedicated server which uses no rendering and has a greatly reduced file footprint. This should provide some very, very dramatic improvement in performance where additional cores are available. Note, however, that this will increase the complexity of hosting DayZ - it may mean that we see a greater dispersion in the capacities of DayZ servers.\n \n**Respawning Zombies &amp; Loot**\n \nTarget Delivery: Early 2014\n \nCurrently to have the server check if something needs respawning can cause an issue with performance. We did not want to go with a "scripted" solution for respawning, and it is expensive on server performance. Player spawning on the coast is conducted by the engine, and we are going to employ a similar process for managing zombie and loot spawn (possibly parallelized). This is a high priority task and zombie respawn at least is very close to being implemented.\n \n**Server Management Options**\n \nTarget Delivery: Ongoing\n \nAdditional options for those hosting servers will be rolled out as soon as we can. We want to encourage a "hardcore" mode that will operate on a separate database, featuring things like first person only, no hide body, etc... In addition, we also want to provide passworded servers that will operate on their own shard of the database. This shard could be grouped, so that a group of passworded servers could operate on their own database. Eventually, we would like to see these different communities on their own db running their own variations of DayZ to meet specific communities needs.\n \n**Animals &amp; Hunting**\n \nTarget Delivery: Early 2014\n \nThe AI for animals is based on the new AI for zombies (some will notice the old local ambient animals making zombie noises and acting aggressively!). We have a cutdown version of this we will be using for hosting animals, including those from ArmA2 as well as new animals such as a deer. We already have the meat models made, and we have the basics of cooking. So this functionality is quite close. It does have an impact on the server, and at the moment we could only run about 300 animals per server without seriously impacting performance (until we have started additional server optimization).\n \n**Additional Anti-hack and Security**\n \nTarget Delivery: Late 2013\n \nWe are working on additional anti-hack to supplement the implementation of VAC. We have been working closely with Valve for VAC as well as our other anti-hack partner. Details of this will be released shortly. The most important thing to remember is that anti-hack is really the secondary defense - the primary defense should be good architecture. We have already identified (and fixed) several key vulnerabilities in the three days since launch. There are more we know about and I am sure more we don't. The purpose of this early phase of alpha is to identify and fix those. As our architecture now relies on the server controlling and adjudicating everything, we can close off locally controlled functions and back doors - which is what we have been doing.\n \n**Cooking &amp; Gathering Resources**\n \nTarget Delivery: Early 2014\n \nThis is a system that was not completed prior to the alpha launch so is half-done. Additional work will be done and pushed when we can. This will include gas cookers (already ingame) and the creation of fireplaces. We will be allowing players to gather resources from the world, such as firewood, stones, etc... This will then be utilized by the existing crafting system.

eavesdropping in Target HQ.\n\nYou would be surprised how much your bank knows about you, not personally, but in regards to your spending habits and your online banking activity. Yes, banks know about you.\n\n\nAs for the bank knowing ahead of time I'll leave you with this example.\n\nBank of Random processes claims for Customers A, B, C and D under the premise of unauthorized transactions.\n\nReport is generated for suspicious transactions and sent to Analyst A, Analyst A reviews information and finds no demographic connection between them, they do not live near each other and the transactions were not the result of family members using the cards with their permission, the claims were not the result of buyers remorse.\n\nAnalyst A sends their findings to Analyst B.\n\nAnalyst B runs a report and finds that Customers A, B, C and D all have Major Retailer A in common with other fraud claims done by many other customers.\n\nBank of Random now knows that something may have occurred with Major Retailer A, based on the claims filed and the time frames the cards were used at Major Retailer A Bank of Random is able to determine 100k of their customers are affected. They begin the process of reissuing cards.\n\nMajor Retailer A announces a data breach between time period accurately determined by Analyst B of Bank of Random with no relation to Bank of Random or Analyst B.\n\nsource: I'm Analyst B, not all banks are soul less, they employ people like me who live to spot and stop this kind of stuff.

isn't getting good gear, it's making good of the gear you get.\n\nThis is very very true.  Understanding each weapon and learning how to use them is key.\n\nA not-so quick weapon strategy guide:\n\n**1. Ion Weapons**\n\nI used to hate these, but I've since been converted to the cult of ion.  A single Ion Blast I or Heavy Ion isn't all that useful, but combine two such weapons together and shields will no longer be a problem.  Some weapons like the Ion Blast II and the Ion Bomb can actually bring down 4 layers of shields working alone.  They won't do any hull damage, but they can make even a single basic laser deadly.  If you ever get two Ion weapons, set them to autofire on the enemy shields and prepare to rock!\n\n**2. Laser Weapons**\n\nEvery player starts with the Kestrel and a Burst Laser II so you understand the basic concept.  Laser weapons can be very good, but are better once you learn to fire in volleys.  Say you have a Burst Laser II and a Heavy Laser, turn autofire off and wait for both weapons to fully charge.  Then pause the game and target both weapons against the desired system (possibly wait a half a second before firing the Heavy Laser if you are trying to penetrate 2+ shields).  By firing together your heavy laser is far more effective since it can't penetrate shields by itself.  Most laser weapons are quite good, but the Burst Laser III takes some skill to use well because of it's long cooldown.  Most often you are better off using a different laser weapon than using a BL3.\n\n**3. Beam Weapons**\n\nBeam weapons have one advantage that I don't think is ever mentioned in-game: *they never miss.*  This comes at the expense that most beam weapons have zero shield penetrating ability (except for the Halberd and Glaive beams) so they need to be supported by other weaponry.  When you draw the laser path across the ship, a room will be damaged as long as it's touched by the beam so plan your strikes to maximize damage.  Beam + Ion combos are very popular since they complement each other so well.\n\n**4. Missiles**\n\nMissiles, to be honest, really aren't that good of a weapon in FTL.  Yes they can penetrate shields and do lots of damage, but they have a limited ammo supply and are essentially neutralized by defense drones.  It's useful to have missiles to supplement your offense, but if you rely on them to succeed then it's time to change strategies.  The Peguasus and Artemis missiles are my personal favorites dealing good damage for how much they cost.\n\n**5. Bombs**\n\nBombs, like missiles, use missile ammo to fire which can limit their use.  Unlike missiles, they are immune to defense drones which makes them extremely valuable in the late game.  The Ion Bomb and Breach II Bomb are some of the best weapons in the game, but the Small Bomb is quite capable too.  They don't do hull damage, but they heavily cripple the systems and crew which is invaluable for late-game fights.\n\n**6. Bonus section: Anti-personal only weapons**\n\nThe fire beam, fire bomb and anti-bio beam all fit into this category and can be very good when supported by other weaponry.  Fire weapons are fantastic ways to distract the crew and take down key systems.  As no enemy ship can vent fires, they have to fight fires by hand which will cause the crew to take damage.  The first fire you set will probably be put out relatively easily, but the second, third, etc will be harder and harder each time.  The Anti-Bio beam will deal a consistent 55 (I think) damage to any crew member it touches.  This does need to touch the crew member's space, not just the room they are in so slugs or lvl 2 sensors are a must.  The biggest weakness of these weapons are medbays, shields and auto-scouts which will hinder your efforts so it's usually not recommended to take an exclusively Anti-personal approach.  But if you've got decent weapons and a spare weapon slot, these are awesome!

Marine combat troops will leave Afghanistan by the end of the year — after more than a decade of war — returning the Corps to a predominantly peacetime posture for the first time since 2001.\n\nAt home, the realities of budget cuts and a shrinking force will take hold in much the way Marine generals warned about in 2013: reductions to training, equipment maintenance, and installations and facilities upkeep; less time at home between deployments for troops; and fewer incentives for re-enlistment as the Corps slims its active-duty ranks to 174,000 Marines, or perhaps even fewer, by the start of fiscal 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marine Corps will continue its aggressive training and development of embassy security and crisis response units to be at the ready for emergencies and unrest in kinetic corners of the world, and it will ramp up deployments to the Pacific.\n\nAnd at the end of this year, Marines will welcome a new commandant, who will pick up the “reawakening” work begun by Gen. Jim Amos at the end of his tenure, setting the direction, tone and vision for a Corps facing more unknowns than it has at any point since the turn of the century.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what’s tracking for 2014:\n\n1.) A new commandant. Amos, who became commandant of the Marine Corps in October 2010, will leave the post at the completion of his four-year term this fall. Insiders say it’s still early to know for sure who will succeed Amos, but the new commandant will almost certainly be selected from the Corps’ strong pool of three- and four-star officers.\n\nThe Marine Corps’ four-star generals include: Gen. Joseph Dunford, commander of the International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces Afghanistan; Gen. John Kelly, commander of U.S. Southern Command; and Gen. John Paxton, who serves as assistant commandant of the Marine Corps. Historically, holding the post of ACMC is no guarantee of being tapped to move into the top spot, but Amos did take that route to the commandancy, serving under the 34th commandant, Gen. James Conway.\n\nAlso in play is a field of more than 15 three-star generals. Among the names generating some buzz are Lt. Gen. John Toolan, commander of I Marine Expeditionary Force, and Lt. Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, who recently took over as director for operations, plans and joint force development, J-7, with the Joint Staff. Both are infantry officers who have command experience at the MEF level.\n\nNeither attribute is a prerequisite necessarily, but there’s a sense within the Pentagon that the next CMC will come from the ground community. Amos made history in 2010 when he became the first aviator to take the commandancy. It would be unusual if he were succeeded by another general officer from a non-combat arms field.\n\nLater this year, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will submit a recommendation to President Obama, who will interview the candidate and then submit the nomination to the Senate. The Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a confirmation hearing before voting to make the new assignment official.\n\nIf Amos’ timeline is any indication, Marines should expect an announcement in late June or early July.\n\nOf note, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Mike Barrett may remain at his post for several months after Amos hands off the commandancy to his successor, a tradition that began in 2003 with Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Al McMichael. Barrett’s predecessor, Sgt. Maj. Carlton Kent, stayed on for an extra half-year after Conway retired to assist with Amos’ transition to his new post.\n\n\n2.) Budget cuts and you. Last month, Congress approved a budget plan that spares the Defense Department from more than $30 billion in across-the-board spending cuts in 2014 and 2015, but the deal won’t undo all of the effects of what’s become known as sequestration. Consequently, this will be a persistent theme in the year ahead. And as Pentagon leadership adjusts to the long-term reality of sequestration, several personnel programs are in the cross hairs.\n\nNone is centered more than the Basic Allowance for Housing. Bean counters have their eyes on that $20 billion annual budget that helps about 1 million troops pay their monthly rent. It’s not part of “basic compensation,” but for many troops, BAH helps pay a big portion of the monthly bills.\n\nTroops could see a return to the 1990s rules, when BAH was intended to cover only about 80 percent of average rental housing costs, with troops expected to cough up the rest out of pocket. Or the entire system might be simplified, scaled back and given a new name. One reason it’s a target is that the Defense Department may not need congressional approval to make such changes (unlike many other big-ticket personnel programs). Details likely will come in February when the Defense Department unveils its annual budget plans.\n\nMeanwhile, expect cutbacks in the funding allocated for popular programs like tuition assistance. Many Marines requesting TA during the first quarter of this fiscal year were deferred because, without a federal budget, the Corps had only $3.5 million to spend on it in October, November and December. That money went quickly. It is unclear how much will be available during the second quarter, but it may be the same amount.\n\nOn base, facilities upkeep will be a low priority, and some family programs may be curtailed. Last September, Amos told lawmakers that some “very important but less critical programs, like morale and family support services, to include the availability of child care, will be reduced or eliminated to fund readiness.” Other potential targets for reduction, elimination or restructuring: auto skills shops, recreational swimming pools, outdoor recreation programs, Marine Corps Exchange operations and golf courses.\n\nThe Corps’ shift to the Pacific remains largely insulated from these deep budget cuts. Plans are on track to push Marines beyond Okinawa and into Guam and Australia in coming years. The Corps allocated $4.6 billion to cover future unit rotations, the relocation of two helicopter squadrons from the continental U.S. to Hawaii and training costs for Marines who will conduct operations in that part of the world.\n\nSome training programs could take a hit, though. The use of role players, and plans to provide more jungle warfare training and cultural training are areas that could see cuts or remain stagnant.\n\n\n3.) The drawdown. As the Corps continues to reduce the size its active-duty force, aiming for 174,000 by the end of 2016, manpower officials will adjust how they use the various force-shaping measures available to them.\n\nThis year, the Corps will ship about 2,000 fewer recruits to boot camp while continuing to rely on voluntary separation programs that coax Marines out of uniform with financial incentives. The goal is to cut end strength by about 7,000 come Oct. 1.\n\nThe Temporary Early Retirement Authority program and Voluntary Separation Pay program have been expanded, with eligibility for both growing from 19 military occupational specialties to 87 for staff sergeants, and from five MOSs to 84 for gunnies. Additionally, once-passed staff sergeants in any MOS are eligible. TERA offers a retirement at a reduced rate for those who have served 15 to 18 years while VSP offers a lump-sum buyout to those who have served six to 14 years.\n\nInvoluntary measures will continue to play a role, albeit a smaller one. Staff sergeants passed for promotion multiple times, who until now have been permitted to serve through 20 years, will now go before continuation boards if they have served 15 to 18 years. Only a few hundred at most could be pushed out of uniform, but all will be eligible for TERA.\n\nThe Selective Early Retirement Boards that target lieutenant colonels and colonels may be suspended after fiscal 2014 since many are now opting for TERA, which has cleared overmanning at those ranks.\n\n\n4.) Promotion forecast. Manpower officials have been cautiously optimistic about promotion prospects, saying they will toughen overall as a result of the drawdown, but that force-shaping measures already in effect will prevent them from grinding to a halt. And in the most stagnated ranks and specialties, there will be more openings.\n\nBy carefully targeting early-out incentives such as TERA and VSP to those most overmanned ranks and MOSs, manpower officials are seeing specialties such as 0369 Infantry Unit Leader, which was closed for promotion to gunnery sergeant in 2012, open and continue to expand.\n\nThe hottest promotion prospects will be in those high-demand, low-density specialties within the cyber, intelligence, explosive ordnance disposal and special operations communities. Those who make it through the difficult training pipelines to enter those fields will enjoy quick promotions and cash incentives, meaning career-minded Marines should consider lateral moves into those jobs upon re-enlistment.

                                            It's up to your GM if they want to allow it, but from a fluff standpoint it could make sense.\n\n**Fuchi Holo-sight Cyberarm**    Fuchi has always innovated in the SmartWeapon field, from our first-generation SmartGoggles to the latest CyberEye Heads-Up Target Assist firmware, Fuchi means cutting edge combat.  This package integrates several features on our most demanding client's wishlists:\n\n* Integration directly with the actuators in the lower arm, wrist, and fingers means that the SmartGun system is capable of making microcorrections to directly assist aim. \n* Holoprojectors in the forearm unit can act as a reflex sight or as a full-on SmartWeapon HUD projected directly into the field of vision.  This means that users don't need to invest in goggles or cyber-eyes to take full advantage of a SmartLinked weapon.\n* Haptic feedback options allow for full SmartLink functionality by "feel" alone - even when blinded by a flashbang, you will know when you have them in your sights!\n\nThe Holo-sight Cyberarm package is the must-have military mod for the coming year.  Remember, you're either the one with the cutting edge, or you're the one bleeding!\n\n**Bei-Fong Seismic Survey Unit** Ideal for civil engineers, construction crews, or excavators, this unit projects waves of sonar directly into the ground and interprets them to provide an intuitive sense of where faults, obstacles, and hazards lie before they can impact production.\n\n    [ Don't let the prosaic sales pitch fool you - although this is sold as ground-\n    effect, it works just as well as those big ultrasound goggles I've seen some\n     of you guys schlepping around, and it's a hell of a lot more subtle.  \n    &lt;&lt;Helmut&gt;&gt; ]\n\n**BarrensBlaster Sonic Assault** The latest thing on the streets is to show off your subdermal armor with open shirts, bulky plates, and expensive mods.  The wildest one we've seen so far is to install a full sound processing and projection array right into the torso, complete with 10CM and 15CM speakers!  \n\nThe Sonic Assault is the flagship of the line, but team BarrensBlaster has plans to go from fad to function: "We love the Sonic Assault, it's the reason we got into this business, but what we keep hearing from our fans is that they want more options - bigger, obviously, but we've also got requests for a low-profile version for the fans who want the power, but on the mirrrorshades side, you know?  We also keep getting requests from sound engineers who love our noise-cancelling options and want them as a standalone, so we're looking into that as well.  Watch our page, we've got some wiz gear coming out very soon!"

Environment^[\[1\]](http://gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20131203/206159/On_Procedural_Death_Labyrinths.php), featuring hack and slash gameplay and survival elements.  After every death, the world is completely regenerated from scratch, including all of the dungeons, enemies, towns, quests and NPCs.\n\nIt's still pretty early in development; we're currently working on the pre-alpha for the next 2 months while we aim to get the game up to Alpha quality.  We're currently targeting Windows and Linux (we'd like to also target Mac, but this depends on us buying one).\n\n**In-game screenshots:**\n\n[Windows Screenshot 1](https://rpcdn.com.au/file/data/mxwtewyqeucr2x3yorkz/PHID-FILE-gfgn7ceecpfevntkntqa/tychaiawin1.PNG)\n\n[Windows Screenshot 2](https://rpcdn.com.au/file/data/fpsi3ybxh4txdysqujst/PHID-FILE-lwhnztlf6n5dfw4wp3lu/tychaiawin2.png)\n\n[Linux Screenshot 1](https://rpcdn.com.au/file/data/2i64pivhohqeagdhvbup/PHID-FILE-ujvw4gf53dccvpuckpqh/32.png)\n\n[Linux Screenshot 2](https://rpcdn.com.au/file/data/sxdksgwpwm5ns4y5hw6s/PHID-FILE-3bqj7jaseefjtsfm5ira/33.png)\n\n**Artist concepts:**\n\n[Game World](https://rpcdn.com.au/file/data/ciqtv5kvtoebe44t37jz/PHID-FILE-pqalhckcfanpbhsyma7h/Environment_Concept_03.png)\n\n[Character Model](https://rpcdn.com.au/file/data/v27zgpjhgffe6oblxglo/PHID-FILE-rrgsdynpnhvwvksgsnrg/Environment_Concept_Character_03.png)\n\n**Links:**\n\n**[&gt;&gt; Download for Windows / Linux &lt;&lt;](http://tychaia.com/download)**\n\n[TIGSource Topic](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=27727.0)\n\n(If you are on Windows you'll need to use 7-Zip or WinZip to extract as the default Windows ZIP extractor puts that silly "Block Content" attribute on the files, and .NET will prevent the game from loading properly if that's the case).

                                 It's certainly time again, the problem is that with near future settings (Ie. CodMW/ghosts and MoH today) give such easy contexts for developers, when you are a US special forces superman fighting Afghan militiamen it's much more believable that you kick ass in addition to this devs can use technology as an easy out, just "hack the terminal" or "designate the target for the aistrike!". WW2 wouldn't have any of that stuff.\n\n\nBut I still agree, we need one.

Today we will tell you about the ammunition in War Thunder Ground Forces.\n\n\nTo make things more clear we will show how tank is damaged. We use special damage adjustment system.\n\nLet us hit T-34 with a 75 mm KwK40 using cavity AP shell with PzGr39 balistic and protective cap from a short distance.\n\n[Image](http://i.imgur.com/inXIkH0.jpg)\n\nWhite line is shell’s motion vector (bottom right corner), yellow dot - a place where shell hit the armor, light blue lines - cone of armour shards. Tail fuse of the shell went off and the shel detonated  approximately in the center of  the fighting compartment. Yellow circle is HE damage radius, green sphere is fragmentation damage radius. Red traces from the center of the explosion - fragments that hit vital modules.\n\n\n \n\nAlso screenshot shows silhouettes  of the significantly damaged modules - breech part of the gun and crew members(red boxes), turret ring engine and ammo rack - green boxes . Crew members were critically hit and are knocked out. Tank combat efficiency is significantly reduced but it is not yet destroyed since one of the crew members is still alive. Now let’s make a second shot.\n\n \n\nSecond shell also hit the front armour, penetrated it and exploded inside - tank is destroyed.\n\n[Image](http://i.imgur.com/a6ZDnou.jpg)\n\nAmmunition\n\nAll existing ammunition is divided into following groups::\n\n    Armour-piercing kinetic-energy  (including subcaliber) \n\n    High-explosive anti-tank\n\n    High-explosive fragmentation\n\n \n\n[Detachable equipment of  PzKpfw IV Ausf.F2](http://i.imgur.com/7PvsIgO.jpg)\n\nArmour-piercing shells\n\n All kinetic-energy armour piercing shells work on the same principle and the only difference is whether they have explosive or not (cavity shells - APHE/APHEBC/APCBC )  and their penetration value.  All shells have similar pointed AP projectile construction.  \n\nIn game it works the following way - each shell has charateristics that affect its trajectory (mass, initial speed,  ballistic coefficient)  and its killability (armour penetration scheme depending on distance, kinetic damage scheme depending on distance, separate characteristcs of exposive’s killability ). When the target is hit several calculations are made :\n\n \n\n    breach check - if caliber is everal times higher (10) than plate thickness it breaches the plate automatically. \n\n    if there is nobreach - bound check. Bound shot is possible if the angle is 60 degrees and more. The more the angle the higher is the chance of the bound. 90 angle means 100% bound shot. \n\n    If there is no bound shot - then goes penetration check, following characteristics are taken into account - current penetration value, armour slope angle, and slope angle of the machine itself, angle of impact. Armour thickness is calculated and there goes a check whether a shell can or can not penetrate the armour.If not and the shell has explosives - it detonates and  attachments can be damaged. \n\n    If there is penetration the shell deals the damage to the armor, loses penetration value and kinetic damage proportionally to armor thickness and goes further. Also each kinetic shell creates a shard cone that can damage modules and crew in the sector. \n\n(for 76mm shell height of the cone is 2.5 m angle is 15 degrees, shard damage is enough to knock out a crew member on a single hit or partially damage internal modules).\n \nThe shell itself goes further and when hitting any internal module all above mentioned checks are made.  Checks are made until penetration value of a shell is enough to penetrate a module or until the  fuse goes off (if shell has explosives and armor was not thick enough to make it go off) A distance needed for the fuse is 0.5-1.5 m from the penetration point depending on caliber and type.\n \nWhen fuse goes off the explosion follows which creates HE and fragmentary spheres of damage.  Crew members and modules within the spheres may be damaged by shards and impact wave. \n\n \n[Stug III Ausf.F shooting PzGr 39  shell](http://i.imgur.com/eLjZSSu.jpg)\n\nAn important thing for players to know is that even a shell without explosives damage modules not like “laser beam” on its trajectory but also in some radius. Thus if AP shell hits a spot between a driver and radio operator secondary shards will most likely damage both crew members while the shell itself if it has enough penetration value may even reach the engine..\n\n \nHigh-explosive anti-tank shells \n \nThese are fundamentally different from the armor-piercing shells. You can find out how the real ones work here. In game this kind of shells is simulated quite accurately: their armour penetration ability does not decrease with distance. Once the missile hits an obstacle an explosion is generated; its parameters are comparable to a fragmentation explosive shell of the same caliber allowing it to penetrate thin armour and damage the crew.\n\n \nThere is also a coherent jet formed at the point where the shell hit the target. Its effects are similar to those of a solid armor-piercing shell, striking all the modules on its trajectory and gradually losing some of its penetration ability with every module hit. The jet length is limited to a certain distance (usually 2 to 4 meters). Beyond this limit it is unable to deal any damage and dissipates quickly. Also the coherent jet generates a splinter cone with every impact, but it is much smaller compared to the conventional armor-piercing shells.\n \nFragmentation shells\n\n \n\nThis kind of ammunition is very similar to the aircraft carried bombs and rockets as well as automatic cannons’ HEF (high-explosive fragmentation) shells that are already present in the game. They generate spheres of explosive and splinter damage; if the numerical values of the blast wave strength are high enough, it penetrates the armour and deals damage. Medium and low caliber shells of this kind may destroy light vehicles with bullet-proof armour (like the Flakpanzer I anti-aircraft SPG). Higher caliber HEF shells (122mm upwards) are needed to destroy heavy and medium tanks.\n\n\nThus it is dramatically important to choose ammunition type according to its armour penetrating and explosive properties. Knowing  and using advantages of different shell types against different opponents may turn the tide of battle.Thus it is dramatically important to choose ammunition type according to its armour penetrating and explosive properties.

It isn't a huge (admittedly elegant and clever) hack. The code size of asm.js must be much bigger than NaCl. I know assets are usually the biggest thing, but still... asm.js is forced to be extremely verbose.\n2. I *believe* you still have to use all the same Javascript APIs as you would if you were hand writing it - WebGL, web sockets, canvas, etc. Good for integrating with web pages perhaps, but I would expect that the Pepper APIs (NaCl) are *much* nicer for writing games or "serious" apps.\n\nThen again, I think those advantages may not be enough to stop asm.js winning given that asm.js goes a long way to avoiding the chicken/egg problem of "I won't use that platform because nobody targets it"/"I won't target that platform because nobody uses it".
