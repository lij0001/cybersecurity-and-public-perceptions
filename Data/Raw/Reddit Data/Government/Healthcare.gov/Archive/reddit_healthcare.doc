Presuming you don’t have a form on file saying they can share health info with you mom, this is a MAJOR violation of HIPAA, and would be a fireable offense. I’m a little shocked your mom was so nonchalant about this — she should know this is illegal, having worked in healthcare. Now, even if there *is* a form on record saying they can share info with your mom, they should’ve called you first, but that would not be considered as serious of a breach.\n\n\nAbsolutely escalate this and report the office. If they did this to you, they have likely done so with other patients, and this is a major deal.\n\nSource: I am not a lawyer, but I’m a doctor, and get retrained in HIPAA regulations every year for my job.

the propaganda ["Hack Gap"](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/23/18004478/hack-gap-explained) on his side.\n\nThis caravan story is the perfect example... what the fuck is it even about!? To say that it is a pretend story is giving it too much credit. People are heading to our border. When they get here, they will be dealt with according to our laws. (Laws which he has done **zilch** to change, even though immigration was priorties 1,2, and 10 of his campaign) And nothing will happen because our laws our fine. \n\nBut somehow this *nothing* is being talked about by more than nobody because this unignorable jackass is talking about it and so is his propaganda network. And the snowflakes always win. Meanwhile actually substantial, important things (healthcare, climate change, our nations *actual* security, etc etc etc) all fall by the wayside. \n\nEven if Trump wasn't a grotesque buffoon who does damage every possible chance he gets..Even if he did nothing at all- the fact that we are experiencing 4 years of absolutely nothing substantial even halfway being contended with seriously and thoughtfully is such an opportunity cost it boggles the mind.

you are. \n\n&gt;I can not support the current democrat platform of abolishing ICE and not protecting our borders\n\nHmm; liberal democrat, but spouts right wing propaganda that isn't true. \n\n&gt; because our platform now is terrifying to anyone who wants progress while also protecting our nation and it's citizens, especially our most vulenerable communities.\n\nWhat is terrifying about the following?  \n\n\n* comprehensive border control\n* universal healthcare\n* stronger workers rights\n* expanding access to affordable housing\n* protecting social security\n* building infrastructure\n* reforming the criminal justice system\n* investing in rural America\n* supporting the people of Peurto Rico\n* protecting voter rights\n* fixing the campaign system\n* securing statehood for DC\n* promoting clean energy\n* cracking down on for profit schools\n* reducing drug costs\n* supporting medical research\n* increasing cyber security\n* fighting terrorism\n* non-proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons\n* fighting against modern day slavery \n\nBecause those are the actual goes of democrats today. If you were actually one, you'd know that.

Between 1994 and 1996 Bill was senior political adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating. When Bill is worried, I pay attention.\nBill Bowtell, Sir Elton John, Jillian Skinner MP and Anthony Albanese MP on World Aids Day in 2011. (Pic: Adam Ward)\n\n“I was involved in the precursor to the My Health Record and I recall that you came along to meetings to offer advice and views,” Bowtell told me.\n\n“At that time, it was strongly held that such a change could only be brought about on the basis of absolute trust as between clinicians and patients, and that centralised records could only be accessed by health professionals … and that no other external agencies could access the system for any reason. Somewhere along the way, however, the police and other agencies including the ATO have decided that they must have warrantless access to this treasure trove of data.\n\n“These provisions break the bond between clinician and patient. The idea that police and security agencies, and the ATO and other agencies could trawl these databases at will is abhorrent. To its great shame, the Parliament passed these provisions.”\n\nCould this be true? In the original legislation, Section 70 of the Act, there it is:\n\n“The System Operator is authorised to use or disclose health information included in a healthcare recipient’s My Health Record if the System Operator reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more of the following things done by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body:\n\n(a) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a prescribed law;\n\n(b) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;\n\n(c) the protection of the public revenue;\n\n(d) the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct or prescribed conduct;\n\n(e) the preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal.”\n\nExcuse me? What could “protection of public revenue” possibly have to do with enhancing the healthcare of an individual, or protecting public health? Rhetorical question I know, but to avoid any confusion, the answer is: nothing.\n\nAny court or tribunal? That could mean domestic violence cases, family court, employment disputes. What could that possibly have to do with the rights of the individual whose health record is to be disclosed without a warrant or court order? Again … nothing.\nUnder current legislation, the information in My Health Record could be disclosed for a number of reasons. (Pic: Supplied)\n\nTim Kelsey, Chief Executive of the Australian Digital Health Agency says that while the legislation allows for warrantless disclosure of health information, the operating policy of the “System Operator” (i.e. the Australian Digital Health Agency) is to require a court order for the release of information. In a statement, he said: “No documents have been released in the last six years and none will be released in the future without a court order/coronial or similar order. Additionally, no other Government agencies have direct access to the My Health Record system, other than the system operator.”\n\nThe problem is that a policy is not law, and can be changed at any time with the stroke of a keyboard. Can we really trust a future “System Operator” not to change its policy of requiring a court order for disclosure if the legislation allows for it?\n\nWhile there are many people whose healthcare could be enhanced by having this type of record, it is essential that we look at some of the potential adverse effects on healthcare.\n\nThe impact on women who have terminations could be profound. Abortion is still illegal in Queensland, and the other states are all over the shop. Can it seriously be assumed that law enforcement officers and fundamentalist politicians could be trusted with a list of women who have had illegal abortions?\n\nThe same applies to STIs, especially HIV/AIDS. As Bowtell puts it: “Had this pernicious regime applied in the 1980s when we were confronted with HIV/AIDS, no trust could have been built between clinicians and those with or at risk of HIV.\n\n“Gay men, injecting drug users, sex workers were all law-breakers in one way or another. The data bases would have been trawled for “law breakers” and after that would have come sanction, isolation and quarantine. Having HIV or AIDS would have become a fact known to the police. In those days, we tested everyone who wanted it, and many gave false names; we did not care. We funded needle and syringe exchanges — helping to evade or break the law. It could not be done under this new set up.\n\n“Such a system would have meant that many more thousands of young people would have been infected with HIV and dead from AIDS.”\n\nHighlighting the cyber security concerns is the breach of Singapore’s government health database, which saw the information of about 1.5 million people hacked, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) need to qualify their support for My Health Record and demand that the legislation be amended so that disclosure of personal health information be confined to healthcare practitioners with the patient’s permission only, and for the patient’s benefit only.\n\nThe Government needs to extend the opt-out period so that the Australian people can have more time to work out if is in their personal interest to upload their health record, or not.\n\nThen the Government needs to revisit the whole of Section 70 of the My Health Records Act 2012 and return to the original principles, so that; centralised records only be accessed by health professionals, all access be only with the patient’s permission and be visible to the patients, and no other external agencies be able access the system for any reason\n\nIt’s not too late to reverse course on warrantless access to your health record. Any future success of My Health Record depends on it.

I voted for Cruz and I’m pumped. I work in Oil &amp; Gas, hunt and have guns, and pay for my own healthcare through my employer. I didn’t like a single damn thing Robert Francis stood for. He was a far left hack that people got enamoured by because he is young, charismatic, and a handsome fellow. Sorry but none of those three things help me at all...

                                                              My vague fantasy plan: Air strike the back and centre with tear gas. Separate them and get them scattering to the sides. Push the middle but hold the front and catch the stranglers before they breach. Smoke bombs and tasers to confuse and subdue them. Forcefully fly these violent cunts back to Guatemala and Honduras with their ~~human shields~~ -- excuse me -- wives and children with them. \n\nThey didn't want a job with benefits and healthcare and housing handed to them on a silver platter in Mexico so why would these spoiled chess-pieces deserve it here after expressing the desire to avoid entering America legally?\n\nEdit: I just thought of another thing. Bring *lots of medical professionals* and position them near the media and soldiers. Let them know that this is about being as careful as possible but there is also a limit to how long the window for compromise remains open.

(strike 1,2 and 3 right there)\n\n-He is completely bought by oil and coal industries to the point where he doesn't even try to hide it\n\n-He is against gay marriage because some fucking book with seven headed dragons and giants said it's icky and makes God cry and piss his magical panties. \n\n-He wants to go back to total free market healthcare, which was just SO successful in the past, leaving only 10s of millions of people uncovered, but not him and his well-off family and friends amirite? \n\n-He basically exists as a useful idiot who will cut taxes for his mob bosses, which he will continue to do at any opportunity, always opting to private gains and socialize losses.  \n\n-He wants to continue to expand imperialism and since we aren't fighting in enough wars already, he wants military invention with Iran.\n\n\nHe's just your run-of-the-mill, vapid, partisan, corrupt, neocon hack. He's Rush Limbaugh's wet dream. He's a a piece of shit who doesn't even give the allure of being in it for anyone but himself and his dear cronies. \n\n\n

At it's core the Defense Sector is just another sector of an Economy.  Surely, it has political and moral ramifications outside of its economic facets, to say nothing of the unspeakable horrors or necessary evils that the actual utilization of a military is nearly certain to inflict on a population.  But, when concerned about Force Generation, Maintenance and Improvements...it follows all of the rules of any other economic entity.\n\nThe [Solow Growth Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model) suggests that Economies advance through phases, all the way from Hunter Gatherer through to the modern "Intellectual Economy" phase.  For much of the industrialized warfare age, it is my supposition that the amount of skills which may be transferred from the private to the defense sector made the Military a fairly natural transition for people which allowed Nations to have a small core of professionals who would quickly whip a large body of civilians into an Army based on private sector skills.\n\nDrove a Tractor? Welcome to the Tank Corps.  You were a boyscout? How does the infantry sound?  Went to an Engineering school? Artillery for you my good man.  Etc etc.\n\nIn this era, jobs driving tractors, working construction, milling and making things in factories etc were plentiful and desirable.\n\n***\n\nThings have changed.  For the overall Economy, this is better.  For the Military...not so much.\n\nI know there is much belly-aching in the US about the death of the manufacturing sector and how we need to "bring steel/coal/whatever" back.  Without getting into politics, from a macro-economic perspective that viewpoint is backwards and counter to the objectives of making an economy great.\n\nThe core of the Solow Growth Model suggests that as a population is more efficiently utilized (i/e it is smarter and is better able to self-select for it's comparative 'best-fit' career) it acts as a "Force Multiplier" for an overall Economies effective utilization of Capital (here meant to mean any resource which may be transformed into a saleable good).\n\nThe Western World (generally) finds itself tip-toeing into what I'll call an "Intellectual Economy", this transition is messy and uncomfortable.  In this economy the "saleable good" isn't tied to a physical resource - Iron Ore, Tungsten, etc - but rather the _population itself_ is the resource.  \n\nThe "sexy" jobs these days are "App Developer" "Lawyer" "Doctor" "Start Up CEO" etc...Intellectual Service jobs where very often no physical medium is generated.\n\nI'm getting off topic, because I find this subject fascinating.  Let's get back to it.\n\nThe Military *has* adapted.  Cyber-Warfare, Drone Operations, Crypto-Linguistics, etc etc.  Hell the US Navy is piloting it's subs with X-Box controllers now, which is *brilliant*.\n\nBut, there are two HR problems the Military faces.  1) Perception and 2) Skills.\n\nAs much as those sexy MI and Signals jobs exist, they're not what people think of when they think "Army".  If you ran a Sentiment Analysis on "Army" you would likely get a lot of responses to things like Saving Private Ryan or Blackhawk Down.  Things that make the military look hard and dangerous.  \n\nAnd second is skills.  There are plenty of X-Ray Techs and Dental Assistants and JAG Paralegals in the army, and all of those jobs transfer to desirable, "good" jobs in the civilian sector.  But the Army still needs dudes to man M2's.  Fire M777's.  Kick down doors with an M4.  Etc.\n\nThe army still needs guys getting dirty, turning wrenches on Humvees (motorpool monday!!!).  Very few of these jobs are "good" jobs and none of them have transferable skills to what the "just-about-to-turn-18" generation finds desirable.\n\nCertainly, there are people who relish the chance to work with their hands, but the demographics do not suggest they exist in the kind of numbers the Military needs, not when Electricians and Plumbers and Carpenters can't recruit enough people to replace their aging, retiring and dying workforce - and are paying through the nose to cover their clear supply shortage.\n\n***\n\nFundamentally, its a Human Capital problem.  Why should I do _X_ when _Y_ is more personally rewarding?\n\nThe only fix is to make _Y_ a competitive alternative or institute a Draft.\n\nCompensation needn't only be money.  It can be intangible as well, as an example, the US Air Force is well known for its (comparatively) nicer facilities, excellent skills training (in highly sought after skills) and its more laid-back corporate attitude.  For many in the "App Generation" this is a draw, and the USAF has - to my knowledge - never had staffing issues in regards to interest.\n\nIn the US the compensation is travel (Americans, on a macro sense do not travel a lot), free healthcare, college, housing and access to a Pension.  I argue that the US Military is the last great bastion of the traditional Boomer Employment Model (give a company 20+ years and they'll take care of you).  It is the last job in the country where you can walk in right out of highschool and live a comfortable middle class life.  If you make it to E6 and retire after 20 years, you'll have a million dollars in your retirement fund, it only gets better from there - especially if your pursue even a _little_ extra schooling.\n\nIn nations which offer a much more robust set of social services as a default for citizenship (so, Western Europe, basically) obviously, very few of these incentives are available.  (The irony is completely lost on many of my colleagues, that the big draw to them joining is living like most European 'socialists' get to live by default).  You're left with facilities, skills training, 'duty' and of course cold-hard cash.\n\nI would imagine that the average French, British or German youth would hopefully find access to a decent, well maintained and fairly comfortable dorm room with free Wi-Fi and a steady paycheck to be a draw.  I would hope that if the - say - _Bundesheer_ offered skills training in some form of marketable skill or, even better, Certifications with a program (Lean Six Sigma, Project Management Institute, equivalents in other fields like healthcare etc) that it might be a good draw in lieu of, or perhaps in addition to pursuing higher-education.\n\nIn short, make Serving in the military the smart LONG TERM play, and even if you can't pay them enough to be competitive with the market many will choose to don the Uniform.  I did.\n\n****\n\nIn closing - I joined the US Military in the heart of the Recession.  I rode out the worst of that era in a nice on base house, earned job certifications, got another degree, and wiped out my debt.  Now, I'm pursuing two masters degrees (Business Administration (Economics Specialization) and Data Sciences).  I'm not paying one red-penny for any of it. \n\n**[Edit]** - I did also have a deployment in there, Afghanistan '11-12.\n\nAmong my peer-group (mid-30s) I am ~4 years behind the curve in _relevant_ work history.  But I am debt free, certified in my field, and free to focus on getting the degrees _done_ in two years where my peers are taking 5+ to finish their MBAs in night classes while still holding down 40+hr jobs so they can keep ahead of their debt.\n\nThe stability the Military offered through the tumultuous Recession was attractive, and the benefits afterwards have continued to be attractive.  Many of my friends say they wish they'd signed up when they were younger.\n\nThe "long play" is an attractive marketing tool, and while it's not flashy, and doesn't have the panache of "The Few, The Proud..." for many it _will_ be an attractive offer.\n\nSorry for my long ramble, I think this is a fascinating question. I hope any of this helped.

the cons to make sure you get the bad news first \n\n**Cons:**\n\n**Going active duty means you might not get the job you want, the AF is gonna put you where they need you**.  \n\nSo the question you need to ask yourself, what if you dont get selected for a cyber position?  What if you are personnel or security forces?  You could potentially cross-train after a few years but there is no guarantees with anything \n\nDealing with the stupidity in the military (which there is a lot of)\n\nMilitary healthcare isnt the cream of the crop when it comes to healthcare\n\nHurry up and wait (lots and lots of this)\n\nSo much time wasted on CBT training (enjoy that green dot training!)\n\nTDYs/deployments can be long and a pain (especially if you have a family)\n\nTechnical training isnt as new as you expect because updates/changes are slow when it comes to AETC\n\n**Pros:**\n\nAir force life/living is way better than the other branches\n\nYou get a job for the length of your contract (as long as you dont fuck up)\n\nGI Bill (this is huge!)\n\nHealthcare (also a con, see below)\n\nClearance (and potential for working with some neat projects)\n\nFree training\n\nGreat network opportunities\n\nTDYs depending on what you end up doing (can be a con)\n\n\n\nHave you taken the ASVAB yet?  For Cyber warfare you will also need to get a passing score on the EDPT\n\nBefore you talk to a recruiter make sure you meet the minimum standards for height and weight.  If you are not even close to it, a recruiter is not gonna invest any kind of time into you\n\n

      I think that they are not actually going to talk about what happened with Jill, probably because something *awful* happened that they are not willing to discuss.  The Duggar women simply do NOT know what they are doing.  Joy had to be rushed to the hospital after many painful hours of labor, and Jessa had to be rushed to the hospital after losing a lot of blood... again, because they didn't know what they were doing.   With Jill, something terrible happened.  No doubt about it.  They won't talk about it; because doing so would force them to admit their incompetence, and the fact that they have no business handling home births.\n\nI think that Jinger made the right choice in getting a hospital birth, however I think that "my sisters had such huge babies" is just sugar coating it.  What happened with Jessa, Joy, and Jill, probably scared the shit out of her.   Same with Kendra. \n\nI do not know who in their right mind would have Jill as their midwife.  We already know her midwife credential is just some alphabet soup certification.  But wasn't she Joy's midwife?   Going through that many hours of labor, having to drop the ball after all that time that your baby is breach, then having to get an emergency c-section?  Yeah... you'd have to be fucking *crazy* to opt for Jill as your midwife after an incident like that.  \n\nWhat people need to understand is that home births carry serious risks.  If you are low-risk, and can deliver at home without complications, and avoid all those hospital bills, you are a very, very *very* fortunate person.  When people talk about big pharma, hospital births being bad, "the business of being born," what these people need to realize is that they were fortunate enough to have a pregnancy, and labor/delivery, without incident, without the need for medical intervention, and it may be easy for *them* to look around and criticize our healthcare system for taking advantage of pregnant women, when you were lucky enough to not need that medical attention.  Not everyone can, or should, opt for the home birth to have that "birthing experience" that they want, because when you give birth, it's not about you anymore.  The Duggar women wanted to have these home birth experiences, with ill regard for the fact that they are not only putting themselves at risk, but also their babies' lives at risk.

For example, Modi’s humiliating attempt to cultivate power in Mongolia; China’s military installations in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka\n\nCherry picking. We have many great victories:\n\n  - Staring down China at Doklam\n  - Relations, Investments and Collaboration with Israel\n  - Japan and South Korea trying to win our favour\n  - Deals with Iran\n  - Uniquely bespoke military logistics and intelligence agreements with USA\n  - Nuclear Suppliers Group entry\n  - Relations with ASEAN\n  - UK trying for free trade agreements with us\n\n&gt; The Aadhar debacle\n\nThis is supposed to be a debacle?\n\n  - [Aadhar based Direct Benefit Transfer saves us Rs 90,000 crore](https://www.opindia.com/2018/07/aadhaar-based-direct-benefit-transfer-saved-the-exchequer-rs-90000-crores-says-uidai-chairman/)\n  - Hackers fail to harm UIDAI chief who revealed Aadhar no.\n  - There was an alleged database leak which was exposed as lie, can't find the link right now\n\n&gt; Under BJP, unemployment has increased by 2%, and monthly labour wages have fallen by 22%.\n\nOutright false. https://www.statista.com/statistics/271330/unemployment-rate-in-india/. \n\n  - Unemployment rate is practically constant since 2010 at 3.55%, +/- 0.1%. \n  - Under Manmohan in 2008 it was 4.12%.\n  - Unsure which statistic author means by "monthly labour wages". Do they mean mininmum wage?\n\n&gt; The Indian banking system, which was hailed for its resilience in the 2008 financial crisis, has recorded a net loss of Rs 44,000 crore in the second quarter of 2018 alone, the highest in the history of free India.\n\nExposing and clearing up NPAs will lead to losses in short-term. Long-term it will improve stability of banking sector.\n\n&gt; The crippling of India’s farmers though terrible policy decisions leading to their growth rate falling to 1.9% from the 4.2% that it was under the UPA.\n\nOutright false. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.KD.ZG?locations=IN\n\nReality is agricultural growth rates fluctuates wildly, unlike GDP growth rates. In 2007 it was 5.7%, 2008 it was 0.09%, 2009 it was 0.08%, 2010 it was 8.5%, ..., 2014 it was -0.2%, 2016 it was 6.2%.\n\n&gt; The reintroduction of the accursed capital gains tax, and low interest returns on savings, which might in one or two generations create the poorest middle class in free India’s history\n\nI didn't like capital gains tax, but it helps the deficit, so okay. RBI is responsible for interest rates, which are actually somewhat high. Inflation is low, interest rates high, so a person should actually get good returns. Another falsehood then. Also, even if this was true, it would be a great exaggeration to say it would create the poorest middle class of free India.\n\n&gt; The introduction of “Anonymous Electoral Bonds”, which is essentially a way for billion dollar companies to legally bribe political candidates and buy entire political parties using cash funneled away to tax havens\n\nCannot comment.

NITI actually does case studies, generate ideas, unlike the Planning Commission whose main job was make up a plan every 5 years then sleep. NITI also gives representation to states, unlike PC which was entirely central govt body.\n\n&gt; In healthcare, the introduction of the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which is has overtones of USA’s insanely catastrophic insurance-based healthcare system\n\nUnlike the USA, private players are much better in India. In nations with govt-provided universal healthcare have a great network of govt hospitals. In India govt hospitals are shit. In USA deregulation of insurance industry has made the healthcare there ridiculously expensive and cost-inefficient.

Search for them. Commercialization of media is something which existed from a long time without any role of BJP. Still most online media are biased to hate Modi. Again, many examples, search for them.\n\n&gt; Regional news channels whose sole job is to debate Hindu-Muslim,National-Antinational, India-Pakistan issues, but fails to talk about the topics above.\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt; India is STILL in the top five most dangerous country in the world for women, and the BJP government has done nothing to re-educate the masses in the way of sexuality or law or culture.\n\nFirstly, is this "most dangerous" that survey based on feelings of women who don't even live in India?\n\nBJP done nothing to educate? Beti Bachao Beti Padhao? Swacch Bharat campaign? Yoga campaign? Give up LPG subsidy campaign? Another falsehood.\n\n&gt; They’re happy to crap on Muslim and British names\n\nWhich replaced our traditional real names which existed for literally thousands of years unlike names imposed by invaders which were only there for hundred or so years, which this forward fails to mention, of course.\n\n&gt; but Muslim and British notions of modesty and propriety are more palatable, so the BJP doesn’t complain about that.\n\nWhat modesty and propriety? Covering up women? Oppressing homosexuality (which completely okay in ancient Indian culture BTW)?\n\nAnd BJP doesn't complain? Forgot Triple Talaq already?\n\n&gt; aside from toilets and north-east connectivity, the BJP has had NO clear wins.\n\nLet's count a few, shall we?\n\n- Sanitation\n- North East connectivity\n- Unbelievable improvements in Ease of Doing Business\n- Vast infrastructure drive, from railways to airports to highways to lots of other things\n- Cleaning Ganga: amount of sewage flowing into Ganga cut by half in four years by building STPs. It was constant at 14 crore litres for 70 years since Independence under Congress\n- GST which formalized economy, simplified taxes and interstate trade, and increased tax base\n- LPG to rural households\n- Household electrification from ~70%  to 95%\n- Massive push on renewable energy\n- Aadhar and associated benefits, see above\n- Foreign policy victories, see above\n- Bankruptcy and Insolvency code, a major reform\n- Attracting mobile phone manufacturing to India (assembly right now, but all countries have to start at assembly and we will quickly move to manufacture)\n- Demonetization and associated benefits, see above\n- Vast improvement in financial inclusion via Jan Dhan\n- Development of UPI, better and more free and open transaction system than Visa/MasterCard/etc\n- Lateral hiring for some posts (should be extended to more)\n- Ayushman Bharat, see above\n- Electricity discoms turned profitable from loss-making\n- NO SCAMS YET!

I have to go outside and scream sometimes because a patient has pissed me off to no end. Taking care of people for 12 hours is enough for me, I come home and no one is allowed to speak to me because how worked up I am. I'd never be rude or upsetting to someone I am taking care of but it drains me, especially if I someone doesn't appreciate what I am doing for them. \n\nIf I can't hack my job which is a 'caring' profession then someone like me who is selfish should not be having children. I get resentful in work if I can't have a break because i'm too busy I think why should I starve myself when I get absolutely nothing back in return apart from my salary.  Of course if someone is very sick then I do not mind in the slightest missing breaks but usually it's because of someone ringing a call bell non stop for stupid stuff it puts me behind on everything, and demanding families. \n\nThat mentality right there is why I should not have children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;
