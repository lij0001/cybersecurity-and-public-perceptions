The U.S. government is terrified of cyber anything because they aren't attracting/plea bargaining the best cyber security minds anymore. Which actually is stupid on their part, but I'm digressing due to disbelief. [I guess the FBI and DHS just can't compete...](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/10/24/how-the-government-tries-to-recruit-hackers-on-their-own-turf/).\n\nKeep in mind JSTOR did not file charges, so this was all from the federal government's fear of cyber crime and strict enforcement. Unfortunately, I don't think Aaron Swartz knew what he got himself into (I wouldn't have expected this until probably the last year or so). \n\nOne internal issue in the US is the problematic relationship between corporations and the government in terms of defining the cyber sector (precedence before statues does not work in a brand new digital world) and not tipping the balance between both (policy: government over-enforcing vs. profitability: corporate job losses) which was not an issue for this case as it benefitted both sides (*Swartz vs. USA govt. &amp; corp. protection* would probably be more appropriate). \n\nIt is easy to put a bullseye on someone who technically defrauded a US company by breaking US laws. In this case, that's why state charges were dropped in order to speed up federal investigations for fraud charges.\n\nEDIT: Also currently we feature a political/government system filled with higher ups who lack basic knowledge (whether or not by their own faults) regarding computing/technology.\n\n[CIA director Brennan and Homeland Security Secretary Johnson  had personal email accounts hacked, both which contained personal sensitive information](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/19/politics/cia-fbi-alleged-hacking-report/)\n\nEDIT 2: By "best cyber security minds", I wasn't focusing on "brilliant" academics particularly but mainly those who have strong skills and are hard working. The article I cited mentions how the govt. jobs pay less than most private sector opportunities. \n\nSo as a top cyber mind, you can end up working for the government for less pay, more bureaucracy, and higher barriers to entry (drug testing, security clearances, etc.) than in the private sector.

OPM breach compromises identifying info and security clearance info of 21 million federal employees, contractors, and military personnel.\n2. DHS/FBI breach compromises identifying info for 20 thousand DHS and FBI employees, some of them agents.\n3. Fahkin hospitals too now goddamn it\n\nAnd what's more infuriating is that all these huge breaches have been script-kiddie style spear-fishing bullshit, not some crazy sophisticated stuxnet-esque attack.
