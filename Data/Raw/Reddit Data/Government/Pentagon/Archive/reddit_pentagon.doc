Media manipulation via government :\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program\n\n&gt;was an information operation of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) that was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke.[1] The goal of the operation is "to spread the administrations's talking points on Iraq by briefing retired commanders for network and cable television appearances," where they have been presented as independent analysts;[2] Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Pentagon's intent is to keep the American people informed about the so-called War on Terrorism by providing prominent military analysts with factual information and frequent, direct access to key military officials.[3][4] The Times article suggests that the analysts had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest and were given special access as a reward for promoting the administration's point of view. \n\n-------------------\n\nHere is Bush being interviewed about it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sITmVizv6X4&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n------------------------------\n\nHere is an article about it - \n\n&gt;The Pentagon military analyst program was revealed in David Barstow's Pulitzer Prize winning report appearing April 20, 2008 on the front page of the New York Times and titled Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon’s Hidden Hand\n\n&gt;The Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld covert propaganda program was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke. The idea was to recruit "key influentials" to help sell a wary public on "a possible Iraq invasion." Former NBC military analyst Kenneth Allard called the effort "psyops on steroids."

Pokemon to have a blue pentagon. So, literally all of the legendaries had to have been soft reset for, and almost every player has like four. Sketchy. I can believe that they traded them over from previous games where they might have done RNG abuse, but if it's blue pentagon... yeah. \n\nThere are tons of super strong and versatile breedables. M-Kang as you said, I see lots of Gengar as well, salamence, Rotom-Wash, Aegislash. I doubt the meta would be less oversaturated by banning legendaries, but it would be load more approachable to people who don't want to hack and want to play competetively. \n\nTL;DR: I'm salty because my physical sceptile isn't working out well

it seriously still news that someone attacked DoD systems?  The Pentagon, and other DoD sites and systems, are some of the most popular targets to try and breach, both for foreign governments, and wannabe "elite" that just want to brag that they've breached a DoD system.
