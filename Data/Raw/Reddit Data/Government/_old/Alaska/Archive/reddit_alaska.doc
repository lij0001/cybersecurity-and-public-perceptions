Which was addressed in the [ADN article](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2021/09/21/alaskas-covid-19-case-rate-is-now-the-highest-in-the-nation-as-state-reports-6-deaths/) that OP referenced. \n\n“Alaska’s overall death rate from the virus remains among the lowest in the nation, but health officials have said national comparisons are complicated by the state’s vulnerable health care system, and that deaths have been on the rise following increased case counts.\n\n“Death tends to be a lagging indicator, and can lag as long as two to three or even four weeks behind cases,” McLaughlin said.\n\nBecause of a summer cyberattack, Alaska’s vital records section is backlogged on entering death data, which can partially explain why Alaska’s death rate remains low compared to other states, McLaughlin said. About 25% of all deaths in the state from May through August of this year have not yet been registered, he said.”

I was actually thinking of a whole different direction as I was putting it together, I figured it'd be funnier if the transporter guy inadvertently ended up resettling every single character he disappeared in the same town, so we'd get like a Breaking B-side arc with the dead guys. Then I realized that it was easier and funnier to just try to think like a hack. :)
