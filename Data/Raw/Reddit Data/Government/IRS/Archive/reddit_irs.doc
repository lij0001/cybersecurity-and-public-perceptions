A whole year or two? We can't keep our shit safe as it is, encryption and all.\n\nFor a few examples:\n\n[Sept 2015, 5.6m govt employees fingerprints are stolen, supposedly by China.](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/23/us-government-hack-stole-fingerprints)\n\n[June 2015, 22.1m people who have had to go through security clearance for sensitive govt-related jobs have their data stolen, supposedly by China.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/09/hack-of-security-clearance-system-affected-21-5-million-people-federal-authorities-say/) \n\n[In 2015 AND 2016, hackers stole information from hundreds of thousands of Americans and successfully filed millions of dollars worth of fraudulent tax claims.](http://fortune.com/2016/02/10/irs-hack-refunds/) \n\nBut yeah, we should totally weaken or do away with encryption throughout all web and mobile platforms. No way that could backfire. /s

If they start keeping data on me, then it is almost a sure bet that it will be accessed by Russian hackers, Chinese intelligence and whoever.\n\nFor another reason, the US has decided that all that cool data that the NSA collects, you know the stuff that was "only" to look for terrorists, is now to be handed over to any law enforcement agency whenever they want without *any* privacy protections.\n\nSorry but the US government has a really bad reputation for protecting data (like the OPM hack and the IRS hack) AND a bad track record of misusing the data once they have it. And couple that with their increasing tendency to want to apply US law everywhere in the world.

HR executives are increasingly being specifically targeted and the campaigns are convincing. I'm sure this person was not randomly clicking links on emails in their spam folder.\n\nThe bar for negligence within infosec isn't the existence of a breach. Did they misrepresent their security program? Was it ineffective or not have one at all? Never trained the person on sensitive data handling? Those could be negligence.\n\nAgreed, don't sign anything and keep an eye on your credit - in particular keep an eye on false IRS filings. IRS has a few programs in place to assist with these scenarios. Start doing your homework and get ready to make this a routine. It's good financial hygiene.\n\nSorry to hear that this happened OP.

This is the same department of the government that tried to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr to commit suicide. That kept secret files on celebrities and other government officials to bully and sway political action. The same branch of the government that was caught using naked photos of non-criminal civilians gathered from personal devices as trading cards and stalking their SO's all for our own security.\n\nThere are methods the FBI has obviously not attempted, they have physical possession of the device which allows them to hack the hardware and copy the flash itself. \n\nIf the FBI gains the tool they are demanding from Apple they will be able to access phones without needing the physical device and without a warrant.\n\nThis is not a marketing stunt by Apple. If they win then every company  wins, if they lose then everyone loses.\n\nThere is no such thing as a dormant cyber pathogens and the DA who claimed that should have all his previous cases on computer crimes re-examined to make sure he didn't wrongly convict an innocent person due to fear mongering.\n\nThe FBI is demanding a private company to become part of the surveillance state. To build something new at their own expense which will undermine Americas security overall.\n\nDon't forget that the FBI, IRS and other departments have been hacked on more than one occasion. Yet they claim they won't be again. The people making these rulings and the FBI director himself has no idea what it is they're really asking for because they don't understand technology. \n\nThe government has, and should rightly have the ability to hack a device in their possession in relation to a crime. The fact that they are resorting to fear mongering, smearing and fallacy shows that they are unable to make a case based on the real reason they want this tool. This is an over reach of the government and needs to be stopped. This is why we have checks and balances. Congress should be the ones to pass a law on this even if Apple or others doesn't like the answer instead of using a 200 year old law out of context.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the FBI had full access to the phone but asked the county to change the password. When this came to light the FBI tried to blame the county but they fired back and the FBI claims it was a mistake. Who changed the passcode and why don't they have it? I have no proof but believe it was because it was the best tool they had to gain public support to ask for this ability and set this precedent.
