               Why is nobody talking about the fact that the https://t.co/W8la0IXX6g site, that Obama force everyone to sign up for insurance on or be jailed or fined, got hacked recently? And apparently this wasn't the first time!   Probably connected to Hillary's email hack....

                             There is a case pending in Texas that could gut Obamacare. The GOP will likely use a favorable opinion from partisan hack Reed O'Connor as leverage to weaken Obamacare in the next Congress. It will be up to the Fifth Circuit to halt O'Connor's ruling.
                                                                                                        @paulkrugman @ezraklein Donâ€™t bother addressing the weaknesses of Obamacare. Just sell your product like a good political hack.  Isnâ€™t that how Jonathan Gruber scripted it?
                                                   MOrrinHatch should be embarrassed by his own â€œstupid and dumbassâ€ comments regarding people who like Obamacare (aka people with pre-existing conditions) heâ€™s an old has been partisan hack who should GTFO of congress already
