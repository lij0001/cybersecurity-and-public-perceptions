Target confirms 40 million credit cards at risk from theft 02:27
Target shoppers have been victims of a stunning theft of information on their credit and debit card accounts in recent days.
The giant retailer said Thursday about 40 million credit and debit card accounts
may have been impacted in U.S. stores between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15, 2013.
"Target alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately
after it was made aware of the unauthorized access, and is putting all
appropriate resources behind these efforts," the chain said in a
statement. "Among other actions, Target is partnering with a leading
third-party forensics firm to conduct a thorough investigation of the incident."
The Secret Service is
investigating, according to a spokesman for the agency, which safeguards the
nation's payment systems.
Investigators believe the data was
obtained via software installed on machines that customers use to swipe
magnetic strips on their cards when paying for merchandise at Target stores,
according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to
discuss it and declined to provide further details.
Krebs on Security, a closely watched
security industry blog that initially broke the news, said the breach involved nearly all
of Target's 1,797 stores in the United States, citing sources at two credit
card issuers.
"When all is said and done,
this one will put its mark up there with some of the largest retail breaches to
date," the report cited an unnamed source as saying.
The biggest credit card breach at a
U.S. retailer reported to date was an attack against TJX Cos, the parent of TJ
Maxx and Marshalls. The company disclosed in March 2007 that data from 45.7
million payment cards had been stolen by hackers over 18 months. Banks later
asserted in court documents the hackers could have obtained more than 94
million account numbers.
It is not yet clear how the
attackers were able to compromise point-of-sales terminals at so many Target
stores across the country. Doing so would have required careful planning by
sophisticated cyber criminals.
An American Express spokeswoman said
the company is aware of the incident and is putting fraud controls in place.
Representatives for Visa and
MasterCard declined to comment.
There are no indications that the
theft affected shoppers on Target's website, Krebs reported.
