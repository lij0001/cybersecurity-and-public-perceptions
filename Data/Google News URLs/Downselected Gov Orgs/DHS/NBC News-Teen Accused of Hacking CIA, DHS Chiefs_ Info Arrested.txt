American and British authorities say police in the United Kingdom have arrested a 16-year-old boy on charges that he's the hacker who bluffed his way into the AOL email account of CIA Director John Brennan and got a look at some Comcast account information for DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson.
The teen was arrested Tuesday in the East Midlands on various computer crime charges.

The hacker, calling himself "Cracka" posted emails taken from Brennan's AOL account last October.
Brennan said in October that he was outraged that someone hacked his personal email account and publicized sensitive data, including his contact list and his wife's social security number.
The hacker has said he is a high school student protesting U.S. policy. He said he fooled Verizon into providing him access to Brennan's account.
Brennan denied any impropriety on his part and said the hacking incident underscores that everyone is vulnerable to the compromise of personal information on the Internet.
